0,Justin Clark,Everyone,9,Kerbal Space Program,"Jun 24, 2011"," Update: We've updated our review to reflect the changes made to the PS4 and Xbox One versions of Kerbal Space Program. Please scroll to the bottom of the story to find the updated content. - PB, 7/26/2016, 12:42 PM PDT Two astronauts are dead. And they represent one of my greatest achievements in a video game. Of course it's terrible that the two Kerbals--an entire species of little green alien men who feel like an unholy combination of the Minions from Despicable Me and the Irken race from Invader Zim--are dead. I managed to keep them alive through disaster after disaster, spending hours ensuring to their survival in the cold black of space. Test missions were flown; probes collected scientific data; rockets would refuse to leave the ground and would explode or launch and then immediately tip over because the balance was wrong. These two died based on the collective knowledge of a thousand failures. And it was beautiful because they died crashing into the Moon. Sorry, the Mun.   It doesn't really cover it to say that Kerbal Space Program is a space sim. For one thing, no matter how serious things get, you're still playing in a world of little green cartoons, which the game never really reconciles with its overwhelming physical realism the further along you go. But for all the things that feel brain-bending and sciencey, there's still a mild sense of approachability, like the fact that trying to plot a flight path that puts you in orbit with a different planet is essentially a really touchy and precise game of Bop It. The game surpasses that categorization because of that sense of constant discovery and innovation. Making a mistake never felt like a punishment, as if the game had placed an insurmountable obstacle in front of me and laughed as I flailed wildly at it. It felt like growth. Failure is a teacher here, one that challenges you and doesn't compromise by handing you all the answers. But it is most certainly a teacher that wants nothing more than for you to find enlightenment. As such, trying to nutshell Kerbal Space Program isn't a matter of straightforward ""You win if you get here"" goals. As far as I can tell, the game never stops, and an entire solar system waits out there to be explored. What KSP values above all is perseverance. Although all your scientists and pilots are little green men, the game is intrinsically human. You advance simply by being bold enough to try reaching a little higher, making your species' sphere of influence just a little larger with every attempt. If you manage to break the world's speed record, you're ready to try reaching the upper atmosphere and recording how the air is up there. If you get there, then maybe we can put a satellite even further. If the satellite can get up there, maybe an astronaut can. If we can reach space, we can reach our closest planetary neighbor. All that matters is that the experience is never wasted. Whether you transmit the knowledge using an antenna you attached to your spacecraft or you manage to land safely and the data can be recovered manually, Mission Control receives the experience, shown under a blanket stat of ""Science"" in-game. If the mission crashes and burns horribly, it is worthwhile as long as you recognize why. Unsurprisingly, most of your time in-game is spent in the spaceport on a constant trial-and-error mode trying to build a craft that can do exactly what's required for the mission at hand. The game isn't going to blow your mind visually or aurally--land, sea, space are all relatively textureless and sparse, even with all the specs cranked up, and the sounds are about the same, with the soundtrack topping out at ""playfully quirky"" instead of awe-inspiring. All the horsepower has gone into making the fine kinetic details almost terrifyingly intricate. Virtually every aspect of a spaceship's design is accounted for here, with literally hundreds of design options and moving parts to assemble--from fuel tanks and rockets to the heat shields for re-entry and the decoupling devices for boosters. And you’d better take all of it into consideration or sure as you're born, it will crash and burn before you even see the stars. It's daunting, but starting small and adding new tech onto successful structures is where joy is found. The actual crafting process is dirt simple, however, because every part is basically attached to your craft like Legos. There's a slew of fine-tuning tools available for the more meticulous player, but it takes a long time before they become necessary evils. Kerbal Space Program offers straightforward Easy-to-Hard difficulty settings, but in reality, the real difficulty setting is almost allegorical. The Sandbox mode opens up every available part in the game so you can just fool around and make the most elaborate, insane designs imaginable. The Science mode allows you to earn points for every new milestone achievement; you can spend those points on the Research and Development skill tree, which is where you earn bigger and better parts to use. The Career mode is a full-blown space program experience where money is, in fact, an object and good public opinion, public donations, government contracts, and farmed-out tech are required to before you can even afford to send astronauts on a flight. This is the most ""gamey"" it gets, with contracts representing clearly defined missions you can perform to get the most out of every flight. It's slow going, but it’s possibly the most satisfying because every new advancement is earned. Both the Science and Sandbox modes feature pre-made spacecraft you can take out into the final frontier, but while it is a huge relief to not have to put in the clearly elaborate wrench time to build anything this complex, there's something a little hollow about just having these accomplishments tossed at you instead of reaching them yourself. The game almost makes up for this because even with a few extensive tutorials tossed in, getting a ship to the Mun involves a hundred tiny decisions you won't realize you’re making because you don’t have to make them time and time again. The stages of every launch have to be programmed in, sufficient fuel has to be stocked to make it where you're going and back, and ship stability has to be minded (even with the SAS feature, which is there for the express purpose of keeping your ship in balance). The blue navigation ball at the bottom of your screen is your best friend in the world, and ignoring it is a fool's act. Career mode is harder yet infinitely more satisfying when you find success. Even when you forge the most ridiculous-looking rocket, it’s a wonder of engineering as long as it breaches Kerbal's atmosphere and doesn't explode. True human achievement, in life as in this game, works at a snail's pace. It can't be given. Once you have your spacecraft, the real struggle begins. And your opponent is gravity. Gravity keeps your craft from lifting off when you've loaded it down with too much rocket fuel. It tilts your ship as it takes off if the thrust is even a tiny angle off-kilter. You fight it in the upper atmosphere as you try to put spacecraft in orbit instead of watching them fall helplessly back to the ground. You will charge against it as you try to create a new orbital path to get to a new planet, and all the tutorials do is teach you the basic principles. They don't tell you what parts you need to make these things any easier in practice (in case you haven't figured it out, the tutorials are kinda useless). You advance simply by being bold enough to try reaching a little higher, making your species' sphere of influence just a little larger with every attempt. But this is simply nature in action. Unlike, say, Surgeon Simulator or one of the new breed of indie titles with sloppy, inebriate physics, KSP's natural laws feel like a natural part of the universe’s uncaring nature instead of the developer’s attempt to stymie progress. It's up to you to use the tech at your disposal to break nature's shackles and crack the science necessary. This is often an arduous, aggravating process, where hours slip away as you try to find the one flaw in an insanely elaborate series of maneuvers that’s causing your missions to fail. The tiny moments when something clicks into place and one more of those chains breaks are the most breathtaking and gratifying of all. Once again, there's still even further you can go. Kerbal Space Program was a beta release for years before this, its ""final"" version. Funny enough, even after all that time, bugs are still scattered throughout, such as ships that are no longer visible, orbital paths turning twitchy and changing randomly even as your ship follows the one you set, and button presses not registering as you float out of your ship . But these are small compared to what feels like the mass achievements of thousands of minds bringing their expertise to the table through the hundreds of tweaks done over the years to the clearly passionate, lovingly crafted mods, which are easily accessible and promoted in-game. Even NASA's gotten in on it with a few of their own hypothetical scenarios pre-loaded in the game from the get-go. On the micro and macro levels, Kerbal Space Program's greatest magic trick is giving the player a feeling of togetherness, that we all have the same curiosity required to transcend our limitations and that regardless of how Herculean the stakes, the constant idea is always ""it can be done."" Instead of altering the layout of Kerbal's UI for consoles, Squad attempted to impart of all relevant keyboard and mouse functionality onto controllers. As a result, text and icons are microscopic on a big-screen TV, and though the UI can be scaled up in size, you sacrifice valuable screen real estate in the process. If ever there has been a perfect excuse to implement second screen capabilities, this would have been it. Most of the hard work in Kerbal Space Program—building craft, moving parts around, turning flight controls on or off--requires more precision than either the Dual Shock 4 or Xbox One controller offer. A mouse arrow can be turned on and off with a click of the left analog stick, and in use, it excels at inputting large sweeping motions, but not fine movements--at least PS4 players have the option to use motion controls for marginally better cursor control. Surgical procedures like plotting orbits can be done, with time, effort, and trial-and-error, but a game that already has a Sisyphean learning curve certainly didn't need anything to create more work for the player. You will fail at this game. It will demoralize you and it will stress you out, but, more often than not, it will soothe, quiet, and inspire you. Innovative muscles will be stretched here that aren't stretched very often by games, and more complex moments require a sort of zen beyond being simply twitch-ready for a surprise attack. Even failure imparts a lesson. No matter how big or small the achievement, anything else that can be done is limited only by your imagination. Even with its cartoonish humor and quirks, Kerbal Space Program has an almost sacred respect for the tiny miracles involved in space travel, and even at its most difficult, it deserves that respect in return.",,8.5
1,Justin Clark,Teen,8,Jotun,"Dec 31, 2015"," Imagine the bleakness of the man versus giant creatures gameplay of Shadow of the Colossus as a definitively Nordic tale, and you have a general idea of what Jotun is. Sprinkle in a little bit of Dark Souls’ difficulty and a malevolent sense of challenge, and you’re closer to hitting the bullseye. Now imagine all of that hand-drawn in a style somewhere between Dragon’s Lair and Princess Mononoke, and you’ve got Jotun. Boiling the game down to its disparate parts does the game a mild disservice, though. In execution, Jotun is a perfect storybook, a game that seems ripped from the imagination of a Viking child being told tales of warriors of old facing down their gods. It’s a wonderfully wild, vibrant bedtime story told with fire and verve, even when the game is at its most stark and lonely. Jotun tells the tale of Thora, a Viking shield maiden who falls from her boat during a voyage and drowns. Because passage to Valhalla is only granted to those who fall in battle, Thora is given the chance to earn her way into the golden halls by finding and killing the Jotun, the Titans of Norse mythology. Along the way, the gods assist her, granting her new power when she finds their shrines and pays her respects. Otherwise, all she has is an iron axe and an iron will. We learn between stages where Thora’s determination comes from in a fantastic, steely narration performed in Icelandic. Each new piece of her story would be worth it on its own, revealing years of underestimation, neglect, and later, a sibling jealousy that turns tragic. Even if the gameplay wasn’t as good as it was, being able to help Thora achieve glory would be more than worth the effort. Gameplay is 16-bit levels of simple, and yes, that is a compliment. You have a light attack with Thora’s axe, a hard-hitting heavy attack with a major delay, and a dodge. Thora can find massive shrines to the Gods in each stage, and by praying there, she earns new magical powers specific to each one--Thor allows her to use Mjolnir for a short time, Frigg allows her to heal at will, Loki creates a decoy that eventually explodes after a time--but all six of the powers have limited uses, and none are what you would call a guaranteed solution to any sticky situation. Primarily, timing, cunning, and luck will get Thora to Valhalla. For most of the game, that cunning involves mastery of the environment. Jotun’s six stages, which can be tackled in any order, are impeccably designed. They are deceptively linear, laid out in such a way that gives the impression of vast, stunning tableaus in places dwarfed in size by your typical Diablo III dungeon. The illusion works. Grand, breathtaking vistas are the norm in Jotun, and they often serve as a wicked distraction from the dangers mere inches away. They’re also often rather desolate places, dark locales that no mortal has tread upon in ages. The game isn’t swarming with enemies, except for one particular stage that sends a veritable legion of dwarves your way. This bolsters the comparisons to Shadow of the Colossus, where the loneliness of what Thora has to do makes the sheer distance between each new obstacle feel like a greater journey. The real problem with that desolation is that more than a few times, you’ll need to backtrack through some of these areas to find much needed power ups, or because you’ve missed a crucial switch in order to get to said power ups, or because you’ve ended up in an area and the game’s obtuse pause screen map didn’t help you. The main events of the game, however, are the Jotun themselves as bosses. The Jotun are simply awe-inspiring enemy design, taking the rather threadbare descriptions from Norse lore, and extrapolating them to the nth degree, with each one several times Thora’s size onscreen. The best is still the first: A nature giant that feels like Ursula from The Little Mermaid made entirely out of living trees and vines. Still, each of the bosses are just wonderfully realized, and you get maybe a good minute to marvel at them before the pain starts. A terrifying shield-swinging giant can summon a legion of dwarves out of the ground to rush at Thora with a scream. Halfway through the frost giant’s fight, the playing field turns into a sheet of slippery ice; when it’s down to a quarter bar of life, a white-out blizzard starts. A blacksmith giant has you fighting in a neverending firestorm. What the Jotun typically lack in speed, they make up for in power, where being in the wrong place at the wrong time during a fight will mean your end in two hits. The Jotuns’ patterns and weak points aren’t hard to suss out whatsoever, it’s simply a matter of using your limited arsenal to deal with them, and often with the horde of peripheral obstacles/enemies each Jotun will throw at you during, and quite often it will still not be enough. The game gives Thora infinite tries, and will start her right at the boss with each of her powers replenished each time she dies. Persistence and learning from the numerous failures will lead to success, but the game will not coddle, and every victory will be well-earned beyond a shadow of a doubt. The PS4 and Xbox One ports of Jotun are very much on par with the PC version. The only major difference is the addition of Valhalla Mode, a boss rush that opens up after you beat the campaign. Aside from expanded health bars, an extra element of danger has been added to each boss battle taken from the campaign, forcing you to alter your attack strategy. The first stage's plant boss now has poisonous spores surrounding her weak points, making it a game of hit and run rather than patient strikes. Alternately, a sword-wielding forge boss has a much shorter window in which to strike. Valhalla Mode is a small addition, but a welcome one. Jotun is a short game, and good players can probably plow through it in about 3 or 4 hours, but even with the ending behind me, I find myself dying to witness some images again and wanting to try different strategies. I want to hear Thora tell her tale again. Any good bedtime story that makes you want to hear it again right after it’s over is one for the ages.",Jotun is a 2D action-exploration game set in Norse mythology.,7.4
2,Mike Mahardy,Mature,9,Rise of the Tomb Raider,"Nov 10, 2015"," This review has been updated to reflect Rise of the Tomb Raider's release on PS4. Rise of the Tomb Raider unfolds in a valley haunted by echoes of older times. Abandoned Soviet structures dot the landscape, while bygone kingdoms lie dormant beneath the ground. Even the current inhabitants, long sheltered from the outside world, still hunt and gather as their ancestors did. For Lara Croft, a person intent on escaping the past, this is not a comforting place. But in her pursuit of supernatural artifacts, go here she must. So begins the next adventure for the iconic archaeologist. In 2013's Tomb Raider reboot, developer Crystal Dynamics thrust Lara into danger against her will, marooning her on a strange island with even stranger secrets. But she's since gained agency. In Rise of the Tomb Raider, she's running headlong into the fray at her own pace, seeking the key to eternal life. If that premise sounds trite, that's understandable. The Holy Grail grants the same power in Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. Nathan Drake, a more apt and recent counterpart, spent Uncharted 2 hunting for the Tree of Life. Yet Rise of the Tomb Raider anchors Lara's story with its own believable characters and emotional weight. Lara refuses to acknowledge her father's death, opting instead to seek the Divine Source, the object that could stave off death--and grief--for good. Even the villains have compelling reasons for pursuing the otherworldly power. Crystal Dynamics doesn't use magic as a storytelling crutch, though; it injects mystical elements in a way that makes sense within the world they occupy. From the outset, the game prepares you for this, and maintains a subtle undercurrent throughout. And as a third-person adventure game, Rise of the Tomb Raider excels. Rather than collide, gameplay and story share the space, supplementing each other and emerging as a cohesive whole. Like its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider places you in an expansive world filled with enemy soldiers. This isn't a sandbox, though--subsequent areas are gated by ability unlocks. New items open new zones in the valley, but also let you explore previous areas more thoroughly. By going back to older environments, you can venture off the beaten path in search of useful abilities, a la Castlevania or Metroid. Now more than ever, you have territory worth exploring. Several of Rise of the Tomb Raider's areas are open hub zones, replete with resources, NPC side missions, and secret passageways. I spent four hours in a remote mountainside village, searching every cave and scaling every cliff in the hopes of finding my next upgrade. There isn't much filler here. It's more of a waterfall structure, where every action leads to more possibilities, which lead to even more, and so on. Backtracking to old areas is rewarding, too. It highlights how much Lara has improved since last she set foot there. It also gives a sense of ownership over the environment--by the end, I knew exactly where that cave was I couldn't enter without the rope arrows. By fast travelling to the nearest campfire, I gained access, acquired the next piece to the full auto shotgun, and was one step closer to building a new weapon for my inventory. In the interest of building Lara to fit your unique playstyle, Rise of the Tomb Raider incorporates three skill trees: hunting, brawling, and survival. Each contribute to their respective fields in disparate ways, by making certain aspects of the game less challenging or more rewarding. One allows Lara to shoot two arrows at a time, for instance. Another grants her more ammo when looting enemy corpses. The wide array of skills works well because each feels worthwhile. Pursuing them adds another layer in an already nuanced system. There are also more actual tombs than in 2013's reboot. These optional catacombs are well worth your time, too, both for their rewards, and the Rube Goldberg puzzles they present. You alter water levels, operate pulleys, and shatter icy barriers, all the while working toward improving Lara's climbing, hunting, and fighting skills. They're the kind of puzzles that make you feel smart, as if you thwarted developer Crystal Dynamics in the process. And when stranded in the wilderness with few supplies and little on her back, Lara relies on nature for survival. Unfortunately, this aspect becomes tedious after a short time. It devolves into a constant process of pressing the same button on identical trees and bushes and dead rabbits over and over again. Rise of the Tomb Raider's world is stunning, but I was too often distracted by the repetitive abundance of resources strewn about the otherwise beautiful canvas. But gathering is part of the overall improvement process, and it makes sense in the harsh landscape Lara treks through. And this is where Rise of the Tomb Raider shines. Crystal Dynamics erases barriers between gameplay and story, making an almost seamless experience in the process. Throughout the game, cutscenes are succinct, but not without substance. They don't belabor the narrative with monologues and grandiose asides, but still manage to build character and establish tone. The villains, despite their megalomaniacal beliefs, have personal intentions. Lara, with clear signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, is somewhat broken, and it shows in her words: ""I haven't slowed down enough to ask whether any of this is real."" There's enough exposition to provide context, but not enough to get in the way of having fun. There is a tragic, harrowing, uplifting story at play here, and Rise of the Tomb Raider tells it through details. It's the way a character's eyes fall to the floor. It's how Lara's fingers choke her pistol grip. She warms her hands over fires, shivers when the wind picks up, and slides her feet through taller piles of snow. If details bring a story to life, Rise of the Tomb Raider is as vital as they come. There's enough exposition to provide meaningful context, but not enough to get in the way of, well, having fun. And when it comes to combat, Rise of the The Tomb Raider is superb. The variety of options available in any given firefight is staggering. In fact, these encounters often feel more like puzzles. At one point, Rise of the Tomb Raider stages a battle on a frozen pond. Eight guards with heavy armor present a serious challenge, but by using the water, several holes in the ice, and the weapons at my disposal, I could even the odds. It was such an engaging encounter, I reloaded my checkpoint just to play it again. This game is filled with chances to experiment. I opted for stealth when I could, waiting for a lone soldier to stray from the pack before finishing him, or sending arrows into snipers from a distance. Environmental objects aided me all the while, as Lara's crafting skills let her fashion molotovs and cans of shrapnel at a moment's notice. It's just another way Rise of the Tomb Raider paints Lara as resourceful. She's a survivor. There are slight difficulty spikes late in the game, but if you've explored enough, and spent your hard-earned resources on new tools, the fight will be challenging, but not overly so. As in the rest of the game, there is balance in the combat as well. Crystal Dynamics has found equilibrium in almost every way. Rise of the Tomb Raider's first shot pans over the vast, foreboding landscape we'll soon come to know. In many ways, it functions as a promise on the part of Crystal Dynamics: there are big things ahead of us. And at the end of Lara's journey, after we've seen her through this adventure, and experienced everything the world has to offer, it's clear that promise was kept. Although Rise of the Tomb Raider began its life span on Xbox One last November, it now has a home on PC as well. And after spending several hours with Crystal Dynamics' title on its new platform, only minor differences were apparent. The lighting is better, especially in dark environments, where shadows play across the walls and Lara crawls through glacial caves.Textures are slightly more detailed, from the footprints in Siberia's snow, to the leaves in its ancient valley. And while the framerate did stutter several times during cutscene explosions and quick camera cuts, they weren't frequent enough to mire the cinematic experience. Rise of the Tomb Raider is also now available on PlayStation 4 in the form of the 20 Year Celebration edition. Even now, playing through it one year after I originally beat it, it's hard to put down. The Siberian wilderness is just as detailed and gorgeous as it is on Xbox One, and I didn't notice many differences in the character nuances, either. The 20 Year Celebration also grants access to Rise of the Tomb Raider's DLC, including the Croft Manor section and Endurance mode, additions that flesh out Lara's backstory and drop you into the wild to fend for your life, respectively. One year after it released on Xbox One, Rise of the Tomb Raider is still a journey well worth taking.",Rise of the Tomb Raider is a cinematic survival action adventure where you will join Lara Croft on her first tomb raiding expedition as she seeks to discover the secret of immortality.,8.8
3,Mike Mahardy,Teen,9,XCOM 2,"Feb 4, 2016"," This review has been updated to reflect XCOM 2's re-release on PS4 and Xbox One, which released on September 27, 2016: Time is always fading in XCOM 2, and it's never on our side. As we train our next soldier, drop them into battle, and fight for humanity's survival, we can only make the best of the minutes we have left. We'll probably fail. But we'll move on anyway. Following in the footsteps of 2012's XCOM: Enemy Unknown, its sequel is a brutal, unforgiving turn-based strategy title played on a strategic world map and isometric battlefields. XCOM 2 places us in command of the human Resistance as they rise up against the Advent, an alien regime that has governed Earth for 20 years. As opposed to the soldiers of Enemy Unknown, XCOM 2's rebellion is on the offensive. We're no longer staunch defenders--we're a desperate guerilla force. This new script supports numerous tweaks to the XCOM formula, all for the better. We're still building an army, researching new technologies, and putting them to use in squad-based strategy missions. But these missions are less about repelling the aliens, and more about sabotaging their global operations whenever we can. We loot supply trains and intercept communications signals to halt the Advent's plan for human eradication. XCOM 2 ties its narrative and gameplay together in such a way that every mission feels critical, and every shot carries weight. The mission objectives have changed, but so have the ways we approach them. XCOM 2 implements a new concealment mechanic, in which your soldiers drop into most missions unnoticed, allowing you to sneak past enemies or coordinate attacks on unsuspecting patrols. This further elevates the idea of guerilla warfare, but also allows for exhilarating ambushes, as you lob grenades into groups, fire machine gun rounds as enemies scatter, and pick off stragglers before they have a chance to react. Initiating firefights takes just as much consideration as finishing them. XCOM 2 also uses procedural map and objective generation to ensure a different mission each time your squad leaves the dropship. You'll defend new rooftops and sneak through different alleyways in each campaign. This dynamism, coupled with the aforementioned stealth mechanics, extend XCOM 2's longevity far past that of Enemy Unknown, in which missions grew boring several campaigns in. In fact, the entirety of XCOM 2 unfolds in original ways each time you play. It's a multilayered experience wherein each level displays nuance, but also contributes to an amorphous, ever-changing whole. XCOM 2's strategy layer imparts the same urgency as the tactical battles on the ground. The squad firefights lay the foundation: there are tactical considerations, from the elevation of the battlefield to the sightlines of the map's structures. Then there are the character classes, each with a world of possibilities to consider: the specialist can hack Advent security towers and buff your squad in the field. The grenadier's carrying capacity makes him the pack mule of the group. The ranger's blade makes her a lethal close-quarters force. The psi operative, on the other hand, uses the alien mind control powers against the Advent, turning firefights into psychological battlegrounds. The sheer amount of factors affecting any firefight is staggering, raising numerous questions as I move across the map: how many aliens are there? Does my specialist have any medkits left? Who has the highest armor rating in my squad? Should I leave my sniper in overwatch, or move her forward with the rest of her crew? And how can I flank that Sectoid before it uses its mind control abilities to turn my ranger against me? More often than not, there's a timer pushing you forward, counting the turns until your target escapes, or the aliens extract their secret data. There's always something to worry about, something to consider, some way things could go wrong as you fight to keep your squad alive. In many cases, I opted for retreat: by throwing down flares I could extract my remaining soldiers back to base. If objectives became impossible to reach, saving my valuable fighters became paramount in the grand scheme of things. XCOM 2's overarching strategy layer imparts the same sense of urgency, and a similar bevy of obstacles. As we move the humans' mobile Avenger base across the globe, establishing links with other rebel cells, we also fight the aliens' plan to erase humanity, indicated by a crimson progress bar at the top of the world map. A real sense of tension forces us to maintain a constant state of motion, whether by freeing a waylaid country, researching new alien weaponry, or rushing production on a crucial new structure. Underlying all of this is a more personal current. We grow attached to individual soldiers as they perform spectacular feats and rise in the ranks. We get to know their loadouts and what equipment they carry. We rely on our best leaders to stay composed, and root for rookies to prove themselves. XCOM 2 may be a war game, but it doesn't ignore the boots on the ground--strategy plans are only as good as the soldiers putting them into action. Take Lieutenant Micky Taylor, for instance. He died in the snow at 6:53 p.m. outside of my disabled helibase, just outside of Kansas City. The mission was to destroy an EMP device that was preventing us from taking off, while also keeping the Advent away from our landing pad. With enemy Vipers poisoning my rangers, hulking Mutons wounding my grenadiers, and mechanical Sectopod mechs bombarding my medics, I balanced offense and defense, accounting for every eventuality as the mission unfolded. Things went well. But then I sent Taylor into cover as the rest of his squad rushed to the evac zone. He was the only one who didn't make it. It was his 23rd mission. I remember that scenario because of its clever design, but also because it's where I lost my best soldier. In the end, XCOM 2 is fantastic not just because of its refined individual layers, but how seamlessly they interact. We think on different levels during playthroughs, bouncing between the commander's chair, the scientist's lab, and the sergeant's eyes. If Enemy Unknown was a chess game, the sequel adds more pieces--and more spaces--to the board. We think on multiple levels in XCOM 2, bouncing between the commander's chair, the scientist's lab, and the sergeant's eyes. Every once in a while, however, XCOM 2's difficulty surpasses challenging, and becomes unfair. For the most part, enemies abide by the same restrictions we do. But sometimes, they shoot through walls and dodge point-blank shotgun bursts. The cards are already stacked against us in most campaigns, and part of the fun is overcoming those odds--but when the enemy AI ignores the rules, the game loses its appeal. Furthermore, XCOM suffers from certain technical glitches: the action halted during action-camera sequences, and in certain cases, I felt as if the game was overwhelmed. My soldiers' reaction shots didn't trigger when they should have, and enemies' attacks happened all at once, or weren't shown at all. But the vast majority of the time XCOM 2 performs well and the difficulty is fair. We will make mistakes--but that's the point. Failure is not just a possibility in XCOM 2, it's a necessary presence. This is the rare game that's less about choices, and more about the consequences thereafter: we play, we learn, we strive to get better. The entire process is a stunning display of meaningful failure. So time keeps ticking in XCOM 2, and the best we can do is make the right choices when we have the chance. XCOM 2 imparts the weight of those decisions, and that's what makes it extraordinary. It's mathematical, emotional, and thoughtful all at once. It's exhilarating, even in the face of failure. It's compelling, even though we often lose. Victory is the goal, but that's just an afterthought here--it's the complex journey that counts. Now that XCOM 2 has made its way to consoles, these sentiments remain the same. Some technical issues have migrated from this year’s PC release: characters sometimes freeze in place while the turn progresses; soldiers can take almost 10 seconds to execute commands; and cutscenes have a tendency to drop frame rates throughout campaigns. But the layered tactics, impactful meta-game, and deep character-building are all intact on PS4 and Xbox One. XCOM 2 remains a superb strategy title.","XCOM 2 transports players 20 years into the future, where humanity lost the war against the alien threat that has established a new world order. The secret paramilitary organization known as XCOM is largely forgotten, and must strike back to reclaim control of Earth and free mankind from the aliens’ rule.",8.6
4,Daniel Starkey,,4,Ashes of the Singularity,"Oct 22, 2015"," At times, I can't help but marvel at Ashes of the Singularity. Watching a battlefield gradually pack in thousands of hover-tanks and carriers as supply lines stretch and groan to support massive war efforts is intoxicating. There's a wonderment here that begs you to grasp at what commanding a continent-spanning conflict might feel like. At that scale, the subtle movements of fighter squadrons and the flashes of canon fire yield to larger vistas, and you can feel the game's pulse as wave after wave of enemies cascade across your screen. Impressive though it may be, peeling away the lustrous exterior reveals that Ashes of the Singularity is a surprisingly hollow game, with few novel ideas to support its scale. It plays like many of its peers: you build out a base, collect resources, and engage in combat. It's a basic framework that underpins everything from Starcraft to Rise of Nations. The core problem is there is little to appreciate beyond how busy Ashes of the Singularity's battles become. When it comes to forming a strategy, there are few opportunities to develop nuanced tactics. You have three main resources to manage--metal, radiactives, and turinium. The first two are for constructing ships, but if you collect enough turinium you win the game. Because turinium is necessary for victory, Ashes of the Singularity encourages hapless and aggressive rushing. Your starting area will only have a couple resource nodes, and you can't stockpile resources as you can in most other strategy games. So, playing cautiously isn't an option. You have to expand--and fast. This exacerbates some of Ashes of the Singularity's other problems. As I churned out endless streams of robotic warriors, I noticed that they all looked similar, especially when I pulled the camera all the way out and the battlefield melted together in the mélange of war machines. Pressing to gain more and more ground kept me from developing any familiarity with my units, which is unfortunate given you only have about a dozen unique types to work with. Each frigate looks indistinguishable from the last, making it hard to keep track of which units you have and which ones you still need. With the exception of modest changes in elevation, there aren't many features that lend themselves to strategic use. Maps are consistently dry and lack character. With the exception of modest changes in elevation, there aren't many features that lend themselves to strategic use. There are no towering mountains to hide your forces during an ambush, no rare or unique resources to exploit, nor any obstacles to slow down foes. Every unit and building works the same regardless of placement on the map, and as you build out a network of resource nodes, you'll see the same desolate brown textures again and again. You have the ability to organize your legions into ""armies,"" which are supposed to be super-charged control groups. And this works, but only to a point. Forming armies reduced the need to constantly micromanage units, allowing me to focus on the larger plan: pinching off enemy supplies, flanking with the brutality of my dreadnoughts, and dropping strategic weapons of mass destruction. But Ashes of the Singularity still left me with scant few options to conduct my campaign. It's hard not to draw comparisons to earlier massive-scope strategy games, namely Supreme Commander. The parallels between the two run deep and cover everything from their approach to resource collection to their emphasis on massive battles. But, despite being a decade old, Supreme Commander still wears the crown. Rather than rest on the spectacle of massive battles alone, it crucially wove finer pieces into its formula to make those bouts interesting. There is one-note to this song, and, while beautiful in its own right, Ashes of the singularity is ultimately shallow. Ashes of the Singularity doesn't have these flourishes; what you see is what you get. There is one-note to this song, and, while beautiful in its own right, is ultimately shallow. It's a wonder to see in action, but tedious to play. Scale should be a canvas for battles, not a replacement for a deep set of tools. Instead of providing an intricate network of systems to work with, Ashes of the Singularity cuts itself down, leaving only the most basic elements of the genre intact. You have a handful of units, three resources, and a basic goal. At no point can you leverage anything beyond those basic pieces in a meaningful way. Without more resources, nuanced mechanics, or a charming aesthetic to help carry the experience, Ashes of the Singularity struggles to hold your attention. As it stands, Ashes of the Singularity feels like little more than a tech demo of Stardock's new Oxide engine. At best, it demonstrates the power of multicore optimization and DirectX 12, being the latest game to push the limits of computing to render a massive number of moving parts in a burgeoning war machine. Even so, the game comes off as half-finished. There is a decent foundation, but Ashes fails to build on it in a satisfying way.  ","Humanity long ago shed its mortal skin and developed into beings of pure consciousness. But the Singularity is a thing of the past and the very future of human existence is being threatened. Though the post-humans wield godlike power, they find themselves at war for domination of not just the Milky Way but all galaxies with Haalee, the sentient AI, who is bent on saving the universe from post-human predation.",7.5
5,Jason D'Aprile,Teen,8,Severed,"Apr 26, 2016"," Drinkbox Studios' games all share a unique, rather dark sense of humor and very distinctive artistic flare. With Severed, the studio has turned its attention to classic first-person dungeon crawling, and the result is a creative touch-screen adventure with sharp, colorful graphics that mask an incredibly dark center. Severed places you in the role of Sasha. Her home burned, her family taken, and her left-arm severed, she wakes up to find everything she loves destroyed. When a mysterious and frightful vision bestows her with a living sword that sucks up power by severing limbs, Sasha ventures forth into a nightmarish maze in search of a resolution. While Severed is heavily influenced by classic dungeon crawlers, it’s not exactly an RPG. Sasha doesn’t have traditional stats that increase throughout the game. Instead, you use the body parts collected during combat--and occasionally find strewn about the environment--as currency to buy or upgrade abilities, which include increased damage and health, the ability to leech health from enemies, or a longer window of time to sever limbs during combat, to name a few. Each new ability and piece of armor Sasha earns by killing a boss has its own upgrade tree, so there’s a good amount of depth to the customization system overall. If you prefer to rely on straightforward sword-slashing, you can focus heavily on that skill tree, but there's plenty of room to experiment with Sasha's repertoire of equipment and abilities. Fighting consists of swiping over enemies to attack or to parry incoming attacks in real time, but within that basic framework, Drinkbox has created a rewarding system where every move counts as you seek to collect body parts for new upgrades. Monsters' attacks are tied to a cooldown timer, and you can successfully counter them by swiping toward an attacking appendage. When done successfully, this will open monsters up to consecutive attacks. Facing a monster one-on-one is usually not a problem, but Severed doesn’t make it that easy—the game frequently throws three or four monsters at you at once. This means you have to keep a very close watch on the timer for each monster and shift your focus accordingly in order to attack and defend at the right time. Timing is everything in Severed: the only way to collect body parts is to fill your sever meter by consistently attacking without being blocked, and, by parrying incoming attacks. Screwing up your timing or the angle of your swipe may lead to a blocked attack, which in turn prevents your meter from filling up. You may still win the fight, but you will walk away empty-handed. Combat can quickly become a hectic, even stressful affair. Thankfully, there are no random encounters here. Severed lets you know where the monsters are with a glowing flame in the room ahead. There’s also no real penalty to dying in the normal difficulty level. Severed's map bears more than a passing resemblance to Metroid-style games. The overall world is quite large, but the meat of the game is figuring out how to reach new, tucked away areas. Much like Metroid, this is usually done by defeating a boss and earning a new ability. Sasha can learn how to change the land from day to night and back again to open special doors, for instance. This is a world that takes you through spooky forests, forgotten temples, fiery wastelands, and more in Sasha’s quest to find her family. The landscapes are equally dreamlike and nightmarish, with bizarre plant growths and areas defined by isolation and ruin. There’s an intriguing use of organic shapes and objects throughout. A giant skull might be resting along a forest path, and within the dungeons, the actual doors are frequently living creatures—scary, toothsome maws that open when given the right object. At one point, you’ll go through a living door, only to find it’s still connected to an actual creature—some huge, worm-like thing that produces foul toxic gas. The whole world of Severed is full of strange sights that make it worthwhile to comb every inch of its multi-level maps. Severed starts out deceptively simplistic and bizarre. The weird, old-school scrolling method and touch-based interactions hide a remarkably deep and involving mix of action, adventure, and role-playing. The more hours you pour into Severed, the more complex it becomes and the darker the story gets. It takes a while to grasp, but once the game picks up steam, it becomes an intriguing experience that's unlike any other game on Vita to date.","Severed follows the saga of a distraught warrior, who is lost in a fantastical world, as she knits together pieces of her story from both the past and the future. As the heroine, players will embark on a journey through a surreal, nonlinear world by using a gesture-based combat mechanic to defeat enemies in this first-person adventure. During their journey, players will unlock new abilities, discover secrets of the land, and grow in power as they master both offensive and defensive techniques.",7.5
6,Justin Clark,Mature,8,The Walking Dead: Michonne - A Telltale Miniseries,"Feb 23, 2016"," What We Deserve feels personal, a narrative so steeped in familial heartbreak that it almost plays more like a visual stream-of-consciousness diary than a choose-your-own-adventure zombie apocalypse story. What started as a typical tale about how to survive the zombie apocalypse shifts in its final episode into a fascinating tale that asks the most relevant and important question of all: why bother? The fallout of the second episode is dealt with, for sure--and how to leverage that outcome in order to please Norma and the remnants of the shantytown Michonne helped ruin. Once it’s figured out, however, Michonne is left as the only true adult in a house of abandoned children. The time with them that follows can be played coldly, but the cruelty of Michonne keeping distance from those in need, given what she has and will envision, doesn't feel right. To take Michonne this far is to accept that the mother she was did not die with her daughters, and more than the machete at her back, this is what will keep her alive. And so much of the first half of the episode goes, with Michonne carefully preparing her unconventional family for the worst. Aching, mournful moments lie within: a mother’s last letter, having to explain to a child what happened to his father, the decision to spend precious time to conduct a burial. And yet, it is all to the benefit of Michonne herself, showing strength far beyond the ability to lop of zombie limbs. It’s because of this that when the zombies do show up, it’s almost incongruous. The people add depth, tension, and terror all on their own. The Walkers look increasingly boring in the face of the human drama that surrounds them. Sure, the action is kinetic and brutal, as always, and one particular death gets especially gross, but the relevancy of these moments in the face of Michonne's layered story is diminished. It’s a problem exacerbated by graphical hitches, with faces disappearing, and jitters during QTEs at points where precision is crucial--issues that weren't apparent in the first two episodes. This episode's strengths still lay in its human element. The climax--a prisoner exchange with Norma--would be an anxious affair by itself, with Michonne's actions potentially hinging on a massive bluff. The scene becomes more impactful when you realize Norma's concerns mirror Michonne's, albeit with Norma fighting for the sake of a far more awful person. Telltale pulls off a minor miracle here: keeping the villains just empathetic enough to second-guess every action, which raises the tension in this sequence even higher. The real action occurs later, as Michonne loses her grip on reality and flashbacks and hallucinations cloud her judgement at the worst possible time, forcing a funhouse mirror redux of the reality-shifting intro in Episode 1. It’s hair-raising in the moment, and an example of excellent direction and planning. With the miniseries now complete, the game’s biggest flaw is in its structure. At least a half hour shorter than the other two episodes, What We Deserve nails the story Telltale has been tiptoeing around since first minute, and it’s something that only begins to present itself towards the end of Episode 2 before taking off here. As a complete story, Walking Dead Michonne is, truly, a story about family, in a way few game narratives are. Familial loss and the forced adoption of new members isn’t new for Walking Dead, but in Michonne--barring choosing to be cold during a moment of sorrow--we have someone who finds power in parenthood, instead of living in constant fear of it. Her weakness is in having already failed at it. It’s in finding out whether the weight of that failure should be allowed to break her or not. Of course, that’s the question that drives anyone stricken by loss. It’s an easy question with hard answers, and this is a game that doesn’t flinch from either.  ","The Walking Dead: Michonne - A Telltale Miniseries stars the iconic, blade-wielding character from Robert Kirkman's best-selling comic books, portrayed in-game by award-winning actress Samira Wiley (Orange is the New Black).",6.8
7,Peter Brown,Mature,7,Hitman,"Mar 11, 2016"," The second episode of Hitman opens with Agent 47 lounging on a bench in the idyllic vacation destination, Sapienza. With a newspaper in hand and a crisp Italian shirt on his back, you could be forgiven for mistaking Agent 47 as a proxy of Daniel Craig's James Bond--if it wasn't for his shaved, barcoded head. Sapienza's laid back atmosphere is almost the antithesis of the first episode's bustling fashion show, and this shift comes as a breath of fresh air. There's a greater variety of events to behold and more ground to cover, and you're afforded more opportunities to explore, unfettered by potential threats on the streets. While familiarizing yourself with the area, you'll regularly stumble into amusing scenes and personalities. Whether it's a street performer entertaining a group of tourists, an off-duty waiter taking a leak, or a priest who's flustered to see you barge into the middle of a confession, there are numerous vignettes that made me snicker and buy into the idea that Sapienza is a functioning community. It's disappointing that you can't enter every building given the potential advantages and entertainment they could provide, but episode two's world feels intricate and alive. It didn't take long for me to warm up to the sunlit streets and coastal views, which provided a relaxing buffer from this episode's dangerous destination: a mansion with a secret underground laboratory, protected by mafia-like guards and professional security. Your mission is to infiltrate the home, kill two targets, and destroy an experimental virus located in the heart of the lab. In traditional Hitman fashion, there are disguises to steal from unsuspecting NPCs that allow you to pass through security checkpoints and fool hired hands into thinking you're just another employee, toiling away in the opulent villa. A keen eye--or a finger on the button that triggers the x-ray vision-like Instinct mode--will help you locate tools to unlock doors or items that take out enemies, such as an exploding golf ball. Hunting for opportunities in your environment is just as critical to the Hitman experience as the act of assassinating targets. You spend most of your time sneaking and procuring said items, and while you need to be ever vigilant to avoid detection from suspicious NPCs, Hitman's unreliable AI can be easily fooled once you learn how to manipulate the way the game handles line-of-sight. It's reasonable to expect that rounding a corner and making a sharp turn in an unexpected direction would throw off a hapless guard, but it's a little silly that you can avoid detection by crouching and walking circles around objects, despite Agent 47's head poking out in plain view. Even though the enemies you circumvent aren't the brightest, there are enough of them to make your job difficult once you infiltrate the mansion's perimeter. Anyone who played the first episode will feel right at home, and potentially more at ease, despite staring danger in the face on a constant basis. Whereas the mansion in Paris was brimming with people and stuffed with hallways and tiny rooms, Sapienza's has more open space and fewer twists and turns. This looser layout potentially presents fewer hiding places--with no crowds to confuse guards and fewer windows to jump through--but this also makes the moment-to-moment action feel more manageable. That is, until you see what lurks under your feet. The underground laboratory is a totally different beast compared to the mansion. It's small and jam-packed with professional security and doctors in a space that's only big enough for a few medical trailers and crates. It's a scene that's tough to navigate and even harder to crack, but its concentrated nature makes victory all the more rewarding. With a swap of an outfit, an errant keycard, and a handy hazmat suit, you can make it into the virus' containment facility, but it requires extreme patience--any amount of aggressive behavior in the lab is met with extreme force. Though you can still rely on Hitman's forgiving radar-meets-map--which automatically tracks movements of targets and NPCs--you can use infiltration and reconnaissance across the entirety of Sapienza to locate your targets on foot. NPCs often engage in conversations that reveal the habits or locations of specific characters, but you can also pursue mini-objectives that lead you right into the lion's den, such as playing the part of a target's golf instructor. However, it's not unusual to turn a corner and organically cross paths with your target. However, they have routines, and once you realize your target is simply following a pre-programmed path rather than living in and reacting to the world as a real person might, their mystique takes a nose-dive. The mediocre AI and animations return, as does the need to repeat the same old spy tricks, but they take a backseat this time around as Sapienza and its colorful denizens take center stage. Indeed, once you understand the movements of your targets, the limitations of Hitman's enemy AI and the locations of critically useful items, the sense of wonder and immersion fade, and Hitman begins to feel more like a puzzle game. This is most evident when you dive into escalation missions. These multi-stage missions come in five parts, stacking new objectives with each round. The added challenges--like not pacifying NPCs--make completing these challenges more difficult with each round, but not necessarily more enjoyable, as you already know how to complete the unchanging objectives. It's possible to clear the first few stages of an escalation mission in a couple of minutes using the knowledge you gleaned from the episode's main mission, and it doesn't take long to grow tired of walking the same paths and resorting to the same tactics. You can look for new solutions, but it's up to you to drum up the interest in doing so as the game doesn't go out of its way to mix up the variables and guide you in new directions. Despite having a few distinct locations to explore within Sapienza, your main mission won't last long, but the variety is appreciated, with the lab feeling different from the mansion feeling different than the streets. In that regard, this episode feels far more well-rounded than the first. The mediocre AI and animations return, as does the need to repeat the same old spy tricks, but they take a backseat this time around as Sapienza and its colorful denizens take center stage. Episode two doesn't fill your plate, but it's a satisfying experience nonetheless.  ","Hitman will see players perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world, from the highly fashionable Paris and sunny coast of Italy to the dust and hustle of the markets in Marrakesh in this creative stealth action game.",6.7
8,Jason Imms,,5,P.O.L.L.E.N,"Apr 20, 2016"," At their heart, adventure games are about delivering a narrative. They're mechanically simple. At their most complex, they offer puzzles that give the player some agency in the world, and slow their progression so they don't just blast through the narrative content. This means that in order to be successful, adventure games need to precisely execute on the few attributes they offer. There isn't anywhere for developers to hide weakness or inexperience. First-person adventure games have received a lot of attention over the last couple of years. Releases like Firewatch, Gone Home, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter deliver strong, emotional narratives through high quality writing and environmental design, with artfully crafted atmosphere. The recently released P.O.L.L.E.N (or Pollen for short) by Mindfield Games fails in this regard. Pollen tells the story of a nameless protagonist sent to Saturn’s moon, Titan, to investigate a corporately-controlled research base studying something called ""The Entity."" The game opens with you sitting in a dark room at a retro-futuristic computer terminal. A robotic voice asks you to answer a series of personality test questions, each answer causing another row of pips to be added to a punch card produced by the computer. The scene quickly establishes the corporation, Rama Industries, as large and powerful enough to ask entirely unreasonable things of its employees, dressing the requests as boons or favors handed down to the ""lucky"" employee. The introduction then moves to the interior of a lander craft on approach to Titan. Over the intercom comes the voice of a Rama Industries representative from HQ, reciting a well-rehearsed schpiel detailing the mission. Their tone artificially jovial, at odds with the perilous activity of hurtling toward the ground. After a successful landing, you head to a nearby comms array in order to make contact with the ground team, who seem surprised by the arrival. As they begin to explain why, the Rama rep's voice returns, drowning out the details with extraneous mission parameters. Immediately you're taught that something is amiss on Titan, and this ominous obfuscation of the details cleverly makes you aware that Rama would prefer for you to remain in the dark. Pollen’s atmospheric introduction sets the tone for the rest of the game beautifully, but what follows fails to live up to its example. From there you’re asked to explore the research base, to investigate and uncover what’s really going on. All exposition is delivered via audio logs, cassette tapes found throughout the environment. Audio logs are a tired expository method, made even more frustrating in this instance by forcing the player to stand still next to immovable cassette players in order to listen to them. You don’t encounter any other humans during Pollen--all exposition is delivered via disembodied voices. This is a limitation that other games have used to great effect. But in Pollen, it feels counterproductive. You quickly discover that The Entity is causing people at the research base to go insane, and to kill themselves and/or one-another. You only ever discover remnants of these encounters, meaning that your level of patience and attention to detail will determine whether or not you fully comprehend what had happened. Without ever witnessing the effects of The Entity first-hand, the impact of Pollen’s premise is greatly diminished. Pollen’s primary interactive mechanic is an unexplained phenomenon which allows you to travel between two alternate versions of the research base. You can leap forward into the future, to sometime after the Entity’s effects have reduced the crew to a single mourning scientist. This allows you to transition between timelines in order to solve traversal puzzles, such as bypassing otherwise locked doors by moving into the dilapidated future, or returning to the past to bypass debris. This mechanic is a neat departure from simply traversing a static environment. It's still clearly a linear experience, but changing timelines provides the illusion of a more complex path. An explanation of the how and why of the ability however, is strangely absent. As the game’s two to three hours wind on, three separate methods for destroying The Entity are teased in audio logs. The tools for enacting these methods are also provided, but it seems none of them were viable. No matter what was tried, The Entity remained unperturbed. Perhaps this was intended as a statement about the inevitability of the events that transpired, or about the unknowable nature of The Entity. Unfortunately, it merely resulted in frustration. The teased solutions are presented like foreshadowing, but were little more than flavour. Pollen’s visual design is beautiful and the atmosphere it creates is strong, but the game falls short when the narrative and storytelling method fail to give it substance. The game ends with a bizarre 10-minute cutscene, which explains little. Short games are wonderful when they leave the player something to ruminate on, but they need to leave the player with something to ruminate on. They can sometimes take on a poetic quality, not in prose but rather in function, a musing on the nature of some aspect of human experience. Pollen seems to want to do this, but is too vague in its delivery to be successful.  ","Pollen is a first-person exploration adventure game, that will be available for PC and optimized for upcoming virtual reality headsets including HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.",4
9,Daniel Starkey,,9,Offworld Trading Company,"Feb 12, 2015"," Like failed empires of the past, I found myself caught in a hyperbolic debt spiral in Offworld Trading Company. My Mars-based colonial corporation had invested into energy production, and one of my rivals detonated an EMP through my plants, disabling them. As the market for electricity boomed, I had to purchase it at increasingly higher rates to keep my company afloat. Within a few minutes I'd gone from a solid AAA credit rating with negligible debt to a lousy D and millions in the red. But hope wasn't lost. Even as it seemed like my neo-capitalist empire was on the brink of collapse, I was plotting my comeback. I bought up some land on prime locations, taking care to keep them far apart so I couldn’t lose control of my critical buildings all at once. Then I built some new geothermal plants--the most efficient and productive energy producers available--before employing hackers to jack up the price of power even higher. Then I used a series of black market options including labor strikes and dynamite to disable the power plants of my competitors. Soon I was the only supplier of power around and I was selling it for ten times what I'd paid just a few minutes before. My debt evaporated in seconds and I crippled my foes, causing their stock prices to tumble. I sold off some assets and bought my competitor's shares up. And it was all over. Offworld Trading Company isn't like any other strategy game I've played. There's no combat. There is only the free market. You assume the role of a CEO of a new company eager to take advantage of the virgin Martian landscape and turn massive profits. But you're far from the only company on the block. Much like the colonial trading companies from the Age of Sail, your aim is to outsell and out produce everyone else. Stock and commodity prices are your tools, and hostile corporate takeovers your strongest weapons. In that sense, Offworld works like a microcosm of real-world economies. Your first move is to pick a founding location--and get to work organizing your supply lines. From there you'll sort out which goods would be most productive to crank out given the situation at hand. And just about everything factors into that decision. If you found your company near good supplies of carbon, but you need to send transports halfway across the map to access silicon, you'll need a lot more fuel. More fuel means you need more money to secure the same resources as another company and that cuts into your profits. Even with only a smattering of basic resources--water, power, carbon, silicon, iron, and aluminum--you'll find a complex web of interesting choices and decisions that you'll have to make on the fly. Offworld's black market system exponentially magnifies your strategic options, making each round different from the last. A big piece of that is the black market. While trading resources for profits would be great on its own, Offworld mixes in some less than legal tactics that you, and each of your competitors, can bring to bear. Whether it's destroying critical structures with dynamite (everything is fair game except for your opponents' headquarters) or deploying an underground nuke to reduce resource yields for your competitors, there are more than a dozen nefarious options for the unscrupulous trader. As games progress, the black market and its affiliated thugs become practical necessities. Even if you can maintain your company without the aid of goons or pirates, you won't be spared for long. This is the price of unfettered competition, and while it'd be a frightening reality, in this context it's a non-stop stream of brinksmanship that encourages sophisticated and nuanced tactics. Shady though it might be, Offworld's black market system exponentially magnifies your strategic options, making each round different from the last. Playing off these options are a series of advanced buildings. Most of your early structures are bare essentials: farms, water pumps, mines, etc. But once you've got your company going, you can start developing patented, advanced technology or create a bunker to house a cadre of hackers that can manipulate prices. These bleeding-edge structures are your proximal goal. They boost your ability to stay competitive and give you an ever-expanding field of options to leverage. If you're losing goods because of piracy, you can research more efficient ways to produce those resources. If prices have tanked on Mars, you can launch oxygen and food to eager consumers in the asteroid belts. Once you start playing with these toys and blending their abilities with those offered by the black market, games get cooking. If you need to keep your hacking clandestine, you can use an illegal hologram to disguise your programmers' barracks. Or you can disable or wrest control of a profitable Offworld Market to pull in some serious capital without having to invest in the expensive launches yourself. When you pack eight players onto a map, you'll have so much corporate reconnaissance and sabotage that it can be a bit tough to keep track of it all. If I had one complaint from this system, it'd be that when you pack eight players onto a map, you'll have so much corporate reconnaissance and sabotage that it can be a bit tough to keep track of it all. You'll have a news ticker in the bottom right that will try to keep you updated on who's been hit with what, but it's not enough when things get crazy. If you're overwhelmed though, you can always tune the game speed down a bit to help you take control of the chaos, so it's more of a nitpick than a foundational problem. When all of these systems play together, it's absolute magic. There's a thrill in knowing that no matter what happens, you always have a response. Offworld gives its players an exceptional spread of options so that they can always think their way through a problem. The questions then become, can you think faster than your opponents, and if so, can you adapt as they shift their strategies to match your own? Offworld is ruthless. It is fast, and it is brutal, and with so many possibilities available at any time, the game teeters on overwhelming. This is saved, at least in part, by a stellar series of tutorials that introduce you to all of the game's major features. It teaches you how to manage hostile takeovers, how to protect your own stocks from buyouts, how to combine the abilities of your buildings for maximum effect, and how to plan your corporate campuses so they run at peak efficiency. And it does all this with an acerbic wit that parodies hyper-capitalistic figures of the 1980s. Item descriptions and character dialogue are a treat If you're a fan of apocalyptic tongue-in-cheek humor. That penchant for cleverness runs through to the core. The campaign does plenty of heavy lifting to acclimate new players to the game's complex gameplay. It introduces you to some other core concepts, switches up the victory conditions a bit, and gives you a string of skirmishes that help you build a planet-spanning oligopoly alongside your rivals. This lets you test out some of the game's more complex tactics in a scenario that otherwise resembles a protracted multiplayer match stretched over a much longer period of time. By the end, you're well-equipped to tackle ranked games and competitive play. It's a splendid difficulty pitch that serves as the ideal introduction. Every moment from that initial decision until the final stock purchase is incredible. I had feared, when I started, that Offworld Trading Company would wear thin after a few games. But that moment never came. I still find every match exhilarating. From the time I bought stock in my opponents, sold them quickly to crash the price and then bought them out a few seconds later, to the time when I managed to keep three launch pads going all at once to reach stupendous riches, every game is memorable. Each map is randomly generated, and with four factions that have distinct strategies that all work with different resource distribution patterns, even the opening is never quite the same. Echoing the classic Civilization question of whether it's best to found your nascent country where your settler begins or to explore for better options, you'll only be able to see certain parts of the map at first. You can either scan for better drop locations, or take what you see. But if you wait, another company can claim vital real estate before you, and you may find yourself with precious few options for critical resources later in the game. Every moment from that initial decision until the final stock purchase is incredible. I haven't even scratched the surface of all that you can do here. It's a bit chilling to think that in Offworld you're playing out the same obsessive pursuit of capitalism that led to the fall of its finctional Earth--an event hinted at in tutorial dialogue--yet it's so recklessly entertaining and biting with its satire that I couldn’t help but get lost. When combined with truly deep and intricate strategic options, Offworld is a revelation. It's almost unparalleled in the genre. Each and every game is thrilling. Every moment is a challenge. And the brutality of the free market ensures that you can never rest on your laurels, less you be quashed by the invisible hand.  ","Offworld Trading Company is a new direction for real-time strategy, where money is both your deadliest weapon and toughest defense. After the Earth is tapped out and the asteroids claimed by faceless megacorporations, the stark Martian surface is the final frontier on which dreamers and entrepreneurs can make something of themselves by staking their claim to the red planet’s abundant resources and building an economic engine capable of out-producing the competition.",6.7
10,Kevin VanOrd,Teen,,"Invisible, Inc.","Aug 19, 2014"," How amazing that a turn-based game can feel so urgent. In invisible, Inc., I have as much time as I need to position my agents just so, but I’m always paying attention to the security level at the top right of my screen. That meter tells you when security will be heightened during your heist, and it’s a vital part of what makes this stealth game worth the gray hairs it causes. It’s tense and challenging, yes, but Invisible Inc. is also simple, elegant, and always logical. It introduces new concepts in a slow drip, giving you plenty of time to work out the details. The titular spy agency is violently infiltrated, initiating a time-sensitive series of global heists and sneakabouts, each of which you control from an isometric perspective in the style of strategy games like XCOM. You begin with a duo but steadily add imprisoned agents to your roster as you spring them from holding cells. Ultimately, you take up to four agents on missions, which typically involve obtaining sensitive data from a terminal, grabbing ill-gotten credits, and hightailing it out of there. Of course, it’s rarely that simple. There is the draw of credits, for one, which you spend on leveling up your agents’ skills as well as on gadgets like weapons (both ranged and melee), augments (implants that offer passive bonuses), and other useful objects. Ranged weapons don’t come with unlimited ammo--they must be recharged with a one-use charger when they go empty--and agents you rescue don’t have weaponry on them. Other mechanics further complicate your economic considerations; needless to say, credits are highly valuable, and while you could engage in a straightforward infiltration, safes and terminals lure you from one room to the next. They have gravity, and escaping it requires superhuman resolve. But that pesky security meter is always climbing. When it arrives at the next level, security cameras that you hacked into might reset, or additional guards may be deployed. With every agent action, you must weigh a number of possible consequences, each of which is informed by multiple factors. You order Agent Prism next to a door and peek through it to reveal a patrolling guard. If she were closer, you could predict the guard’s route for the next turn, but that’s just not working out. Do you open the door and risk alerting the guard so you can set up an ambush? And what about that security camera in there? Do you activate Agent Decker’s stealth rig and send him in knowing that the rig has a six-turn cooldown, or do you use your portable AI program Incognita to hack the security camera but use up all of your power resource in the process? You need power to fire your weapons and hack terminals, so this isn’t a decision to take lightly. Easier difficulty levels give you a limited number of chances to rewind a turn if you don’t care for the outcome, and the easiest difficulty also lets you restart a mission if it goes awry, albeit with a new procedurally-generated layout. Losing progress with a rewind or a restart feels like its own kind of failure, and this negative reinforcement ensures that even easy mode can be stressful, even when you know you can call backsies. Should you lose any agents, they’re gone from the current campaign for good, unless you revive them with medigel. This requires not only having the healing kit on hand, but maneuvering another agent into a potentially disastrous situation. Brilliantly, however, your downed agent may be taken alive by the mysterious enemy organization, which leads to a jailbreak mission. The captured agent may represent an acceptable loss: you have a limited number of in-game hours before the final mission is initiated. Feel free to let Agent Decker languish in his cell; you’ve got to think about the greater good (if money and revenge can be considered the greater good, anyway.) You might be more inclined to rescue a captured agent--or to mourn her if she bleeds out during the heist--if you’ve developed a connection with her. Unit perma-death is another mechanic that invites comparisons between Invisible, Inc. and XCOM, but I was never attached to any given agent. There’s a little flavor dialogue between agents here and there, but it’s too brief and sporadic to engender any emotional response. The cool-future visuals and angular character designs are decisively slick, but the vaults and offices you infiltrate look more or less the same as you progress. You know you’re in Australia or Brazil, but there’s no audiovisual hook to remind you of the international stakes. Strolling guards always mutter the same handful of bland responses when alerted, and the tilesets don’t evoke the locale. In Invisible, Inc., I regretted losing agents not because I mourned the loss of a comrade I’d trained and groomed, but because I’d lost a flesh-and-bones tool from my toolbox. Nonetheless, this emotional distance is merely a minor issue. I don’t care much about Invisible Inc.'s throwaway story and its last-minute grasps at meaningful themes, or about my agents’ personal backgrounds. Like the game, my efforts are focused on getting the job done, emotionally disengaged but intellectually centered. I bask in the stylish cutscenes and the sharp voiceover, but my attachment is not to the agency or its people but to the sheer pleasure of a successful heist.

11,Mike Mahardy,Teen,10,Uncharted 4: A Thief's End,"May 10, 2016"," ""We receive the due reward of our deeds."" So reads the inscription on an artifact discovered in the early hours of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. It's a passage from the Bible, spoken by Saint Dismas, a man crucified on the same day as Jesus. He spent years robbing and murdering innocent people before being sentenced to death for his crimes. And with those last words of revelation, Dismas earned the title of the Penitent Thief. This anecdote sets the tone for a powerful game about loss, betrayal, regret, and redemption. In both its momentous set pieces and its intimate, personal moments, Uncharted 4 drives its narrative forward with a rare understanding of its characters, its world, and the gameplay tying them all together. It's a stunning combination of disparate parts. It's a breathtaking marvel of a game. By this point in the series, developer Naughty Dog has led us across the globe in search of famous treasures from equally famous legends: we unearthed El Dorado in the Amazon rainforest, found the Cintamani Stone deep in the Himalayas, and entered Iram of the Pillars, a sandswept city with a religious history of its own. In Uncharted 4, however, we find protagonist Nathan Drake leading a quiet life with freelance journalist Elena Fisher, who happens to be his wife. They live in New Orleans. They have a three-bedroom house. They play video games together. But this all changes with the return of Nathan's older brother Sam, who was presumed dead for 15 years. Not only is he alive and well, but he's fallen in with criminals, and needs help paying a debt. He also has a lead on one of history's greatest treasures: the loot of the pirate Henry Avery, which the brothers have sought since their early days of treasure hunting. Now, with Nathan forced out of his calm life, they set off to chase their elusive white whale. Sam's arrival not only upends Nathan's newfound domestication, but complicates his emotional life as well. Uncharted 4 gives us insight into his past, and the way it shaped his psyche: how he despises authority; how he uses humor as a shield; how he long ago accepted violence as a justifiable means to an end. Uncharted 4 tells this story with affection, showing an expert attention to detail in the way Nathan's voice falters when discussing his childhood, or how he stares at Elena when she's not looking. These details are painfully human. They bring the characters to life. This nuanced take on Nathan's personality is reflected in Uncharted 4's gameplay, too. As with previous titles, Uncharted 4 revolves around third-person combat, climbing, and puzzle-solving. But, unlike its predecessors, this game often lets you sneak past enemy soldiers without doing any harm at all. This is a clear influence from The Last of Us, developer Naughty Dog's darker take on a third-person adventure. Stealth requires a patient, measured approach--but it feeds into the idea of a more reserved Nathan. Uncharted 4's action flows seamlessly alongside its narrative. It's a fluid, believable experience when it all comes together. There are minor mechanical problems: the cover mechanic can send you to the wrong obstacle or wall in the middle of firefights, and rarely, Nathan will grab the wrong ledge when climbing. But these observations wash away within the grand scheme of things. There's always something incredible around the corner to erase the momentary annoyances. Uncharted 4's action flows seamlessly along with its narrative. The game borrows from The Last of Us in terms of structure as well. Much like its cousin, Uncharted 4 embraces a more open approach with much of its level design. There are small sandboxes where you climb towers, learn the layout, mark enemies, and choose to fight through them, or circumvent the group in the interest of a quiet escape. These areas would hurt the pace of a lesser game, but Uncharted 4 keeps tension alive even in its calculated moments, transitioning from open areas to action sequences without halting the momentum. Speaking of: Uncharted 4's set-pieces are the best in the series, and among the best-coordinated stunts in the medium. There's a heist in Tuscany. There's an acrobatic escape along the cliffs of Scotland. There's a chase through a busy marketplace, and it opens onto farmland as you leap between trucks, slide through the mud, and crash through shacks in the Madagascar countryside. Just when you think Uncharted 4 might settle into a steady rhythm, it throws something new at you with high velocity and incredible power. These sequences give you agency, but also enough guidance to maintain the euphoric rush of a car chase without constantly dying. I'm reminded of Half-Life 2's escape from City 17, where you sprint through apartments and over rooftops, controlling your character while the game directs you without sacrificing tension in the process. The key difference with Uncharted 4 is how it directs you with its camera and lighting, guiding you to the correct ledge or doorway or crumbling wall as you leap through explosions and plumes of smoke. Audio cues also aid you--characters shout over the din of gunfire, telling you when to fight and when to keep running. The dialogue makes sense within the moment. And then there's the presentation of it all. The cinematography, both in-game and during cutscenes, amplifies the wonder of this gorgeous world. It's not enough to call the jungles lush. They're vibrant. It's not enough to call the game's version of Scotland vast. It's majestic. There's also incredible animation at play, and it sets a new watermark for games in the way it can illustrate subtle emotions like distrust and yearning. Sweeping camera shots and intimate close-ups tie the characters to the beautiful locales, as Drake gazes toward mythical places he only dreamed of as a kid. Uncharted 4 doesn't root its visuals in the hues of realism, but rather, paints the world as it might look to someone intent on exploring every inch of it--someone intoxicated by the prospect of adventure. Uncharted 4's cinematography, both in cutscenes and out, amplifies the wonder of its gorgeous world. Uncharted 4's multiplayer, though, ditches grounded storytelling in favor of all-out chaos: Nathan Drake clones swing from grappling hooks. Victor Sullivans pistol-whip each other. The villains of past Uncharted games lob grenades and fire RPGs and beat one another into a pulp. This all plays out in multiplayer mode staples such as team deathmatch and zone control. But then there are Mysticals--attacks that make use of the artifacts we've become familiar with throughout the series. El Dorado summons aggressive spectres to attack your foes, the Cintamani Stone revives fallen teammates, and the Djinn lets you teleport short distances, blinking from spot to spot for a tactical advantage. In addition to these fantastical elements, you can earn gold through kills and revives, and find it scattered across multiplayer maps. It lets you add Mysticals to your inventory, but also lets you summon AI snipers and medics to aid your team's efforts. Uncharted 4's multiplayer exhibits the necessary creativity to elevate its already fluid third-person mechanics. But although the multiplayer works well, and features a progression system that can keep you playing past your first few matches, it is not the primary draw. The draw of Uncharted 4 is its remarkable single-player journey. How each of its parts feeds into the same cohesive whole. This is a narrative that continues in its gameplay, as Nathan places a reassuring hand on his brother's shoulder, or mutters a joke in Elena's ear. Uncharted 4 is so meticulous, you get the sense that its characters are thinking things we'll never hear out loud. ""We have a lot of ground to cover,"" one person says. Is that in reference to the journey, or the first uncertain step toward forgiveness? We can read it however we want. Uncharted 4's gameplay pushes the narrative forward, the narrative feeds off its gameplay, and every detail coalesces to create something bigger. Uncharted 4 bounces between set pieces and personal moments with such grace, with such skill and poise and affection for its characters, that you don't mind when the guns stop firing, and the smoke clears, and Nathan gets a moment to breathe. Yes, this is a thrilling adventure through exotic locations, with spectacular action sequences and a pacing that pulls you through with ease. I had a smile on my face the second it began. But it's also a story about family. It's a story about self-examination. It's a story about making sacrifices for the ones you care about. And most of all, as its final moments make clear, this is a story about storytelling--the importance we lend our idols, legends, and myths. How we pass down the ones that inspire us. How an old photo of three friends sitting on a pile of gold can unleash a flood of memories. Uncharted 4 is a challenge to the medium. In its writing, in its design, in its understanding of what makes games unique, Uncharted 4 is something to aspire to. It's a shining example. And we'll be talking about it for years to come.  ",Uncharted 4: A Thief's End will explore what it means when Drake is forced back into the world of thieves.,9
12,Mat Paget,,8,Chronos,"Mar 28, 2016"," Chronos is a game about combat mastery. Hostile encounters lead you through its world, separated only by puzzles and moments of discovery. Understanding your enemies and overcoming them is key to moving forward, while death acts as the teacher that keeps you after class to discuss what you did wrong. Some foes can prove highly difficult, but learning their patterns and how they react to your actions turns such encounters from stilted and daunting to rhythmic and exhilarating. Chronos could be accused of mimicking a number of different games, but what it does with all it has makes for a highly enjoyable experience that stands on its own despite a few flaws. A third-person action-adventure game, Chronos puts you in control of an 18 year old character, and every time you die and respawn, you age a year. With aging comes changes to your character. While you're young, there's a bigger emphasis on your strength, agility, and vitality stats, but that wanes as you grow older--your arcane stat becomes more significant, as your other three stats grow at a slower rate. Starting at age 20, you earn a trait every 10 years that grants you a significant stat boost in either strength, agility, arcane, or vitality. Getting older is just as scary as it is in real life, so staying alive feels paramount to staying strong and healthy; thankfully, it's not quite as dire as that since I felt like I needed to restart because I had gotten too old--you don't lose any of the points you assign after leveling up. Your options in combat consist of attacking, dodging, and blocking. Your weapon of choice should correspond to where you're putting your skill points; if you use a sword, you'll benefit from more agility, while an axe will become more powerful with a higher strength stat. It's unfortunate that there are more strength-oriented weapons earlier in the game, as I only got a chance to switch up my sword for a worthwhile weapon when I was deep into the second half of my playthrough. Arcane is Chronos's form of magic, though it acts less like what you'd expect and more like a power attack. However, this isn't a bad thing, as executing arcane-infused attacks is incredibly satisfying. When you get the first arcane stone, it adds a little extra kick to your heavy attacks. Additionally, your attacks become infused with the arcane magic when you dodge at the right time, further enhancing the satisfying rhythm of combat. Puzzle solutions range from finding and combining the right items to spotting hidden points of interest in the environment. The former works every time, however, the puzzles that require a keen eye can be a pain; an early puzzle that required me to notice a relatively small detail had me stumped for quite a while. The solution consisted of looking intently at something I wasn't yet able to interact with, so I just brushed it off as something I would deal with later. Eventually, after going through every room and tinkering with every little thing a couple times, I discovered the solution and was able to progress--it was a frustrating bump in what was and would continue to be an engaging adventure. The story revolves around three different worlds, defeating three bosses, and then slaying a dragon. There's more to it, and it even (sort of) explains why you age a year every time you die; however, it's all delivered through computer terminals, books, and other optional articles. It's not the most exciting or interesting narrative, and you won't feel lost or confused if you choose to ignore it--the sparse narrative acts more as a world-building device than anything else. Chronos allows itself to be all about the combat, puzzle-solving, and adventure. Initially, Chronos didn't strike me as something that would make much sense in virtual reality. However, as I played, my mind was quickly changed. Chronos made things you wouldn't even think about in a non-VR game stand out in effective ways. Gigantic enemies feel huge and made my palms sweat more than I'd like to admit, and there's a type of enemy that only moves when you don't look at it--not your character, you. These seemingly small touches make a big impact when playing in VR. Chronos made things you wouldn't even think about in a non-VR game stand out in effective ways. Chronos is played at a fixed camera angle that shifts as you explore the world, similar to classic Resident Evil games. In one room you'll be positioned on top of a table, while in the next you could be looking down on your character from a ceiling corner. This method allows for great scene composition, adding to Chronos' already foreboding atmosphere in an awesome way. One particular moment sets a creepy mood as you--the viewer--are put behind the bars of a prison cell, watching your character move about on the other side. This approach is a defining element of Chronos, and it's a boon the majority of the time, but it proves problematic on occasion when you have to judge the location of pitfalls from an ill-fitting perspective. Enemies can also get in your way and obstruct your view, and while this is a rare occurrence, it plagues your encounter with the last boss, who's otherwise frustrating. It's a disappointing bookend to what is otherwise a game filled with fantastic enemies and rewarding combat. Chronos' flaws are obvious, but thankfully few and far between. When you push your way through its more annoying aspects, it welcomes you with enticingly grim set pieces and tense encounters. It's a highly-rewarding game that proves you can leverage VR to enhance traditional games, but Chronos doesn't use it as a crutch; it stands tall all on its own.",Chronos is an atmospheric RPG that chronicles one young hero’s lifelong quest to save their homeland from a great evil.,
13,Scott Butterworth,Teen,7,Battleborn,"May 3, 2016"," For a game with so many strong personalities, Battleborn somehow lacks a cohesive identity. Every facet from the characters to the progression to the visual presentation feels overloaded with ideas--some good, some bad, some just confusing. Because it throws so much against the wall, the end result is a scattered grabbag of manic gameplay, complex leveling, and cartoony humor. It vacillates wildly between excitement and predictability, innovation and routine, inspiration and incomprehensibility. In short, Battleborn is fun but messy, and while I appreciate its hyper-stimulating approach, parsing the experience underneath can be maddeningly tricky. The best example of Battleborn's deep-seated identity crisis is its massive 25-character roster. Though technically a first-person shooter, the game's heroes utilize all sorts of preset weapons, abilities, and roles that pull from every influence imaginable. There's a longbow-wielding wood elf, a penguin piloting a mech suit, a cybernetically-enhanced luchador--the list goes on. Impressively, even characters that seem superficially similar inevitably offer something unique that makes their gameplay memorable and enjoyable--be it a particularly powerful super or simply a higher than average movement speed. This mechanical variety is not only remarkable, it also drives Battleborn's longevity. Where other game's dole out new tools or gear as you progress, Battleborn builds these unlocks into entirely new characters. You'll unlock new heroes steadily and without much conscious effort, so you'll generally have one or two new options by the time you've outgrown your current character. Unfortunately, you might outgrow them more quickly than you'd expect. Testing out a new hero for the first time can feel a bit overwhelming since some abilities' specific requirements and effects aren't super apparent, but as soon as you overcome this initial teething period, each heroes' gameplay loop starts to grow routine. This is, in part, a symptom of Battleborn's approach to action: its gameplay is fast and frantic, but also light and loose. Forgiving design choices like infinite sprint and ammo, no fall damage, and the ability to reload while sprinting encourage players to move and shoot rather than stop and think. As a result, I found I generally just had to spam the primary attack button, trigger my special abilities whenever possible, and occasionally retreat to let my shields recharge. This is especially true during the cooperative campaign, which consists of eight loosely connected missions that feel more like Destiny's Strikes than a carefully crafted, narrative-driven story mode. Enemies are, for the most part, brainless and predictable; cutting them down in droves can feel empowering, but it also underscores the repetitive, simplistic nature of the baseline combat. It's also somewhat frustrating that all eight missions repeatedly remix the same three scenarios: defend the asset, escort the robot, and kill the boss. Thanks to the variety of the characters and frenetic energy of the combat, however, Battleborn can still end up being a blast. Sure, the moment to moment gameplay feels superficial, but when your five-man squad is getting absolutely swarmed and you've already sunk 45 minutes into a mission and you've run out of respawns, the tension and chaos combine to form a powerful engine of fun. Plus, as you get deeper into the campaign, a discernable difficulty arc emerges and helps give the whole affair some much needed momentum. A word of warning, though: if you're playing alone, you won't have much fun. Without other players, combat becomes a slog and certain objectives become nearly impossible. But hey, at least there's split-screen co-op and streamlined matchmaking. Outside of the eight campaign missions, Battleborn offers three competitive multiplayer modes, and here the gameplay develops a slightly more strategic sheen. Unlike the mindless fodder you fight in the campaign, multiplayer pits heroes against heroes, which forces you to approach combat more thoughtfully. If you're playing a melee character, for example, charging directly at your opponents is suddenly way more dangerous, so you're forced to seek advantageous positions and strike judiciously. Healers and support characters also become more crucial; team composition can occasionally turn a match's outcome into a forgone conclusion, so choose wisely or suffer humiliation. The modes themselves add an extra layer of strategy as well. Meltdown, for example, requires both teams to guide minions to designated grinders. The more robots reach the grinder, the more points that team scores. This and the somewhat similar Incursion mode borrow MOBA elements to create setups that emphasize objectives over kills. In practice, this equates to action that's less chaotic but far more involving than anything in the campaign, and the combination of distinct characters and MOBA-inspired objectives makes Battleborn's multiplayer feel genuinely fresh. This component is by no means flawless, however. The added strategic depth helps but doesn't eliminate the simplicity of the core gameplay, but more importantly, there's not quite enough content to make Battleborn feel totally substantial. The three modes offer just two maps apiece, and while that's not unusual for a MOBA, it's awfully light for a shooter--especially one with a relatively short, unadorned campaign. The game's also missing certain amenities like killcams, and for some reason, you can't simply vote on a new map when a match concludes. Your team is automatically dissolved and you're booted to the home screen every time, which is especially troubling given the game's team-based nature. There's also an issue with Battleborn's in-match leveling system. The game features several forms of experience and progression--including individual character leveling, unlockable gear, and an overall ""Command"" rank--but the most impactful system is the on-the-fly leveling that occurs within each mission and match (another concept swiped from MOBAs). In essence, every character has a unique 10-tier skill tree. Each tier contains two mutually exclusive upgrades. As players earn XP while playing, they'll gradually work their up the tree until one skill at each tier is unlocked. At the end of the match or mission, the tree resets. In the campaign, this system works remarkably well. I never felt hindered starting at zero, but I was always glad to have all my fully leveled abilities back by the end. Many of those upgrades only marginally improve the effectiveness of an existing ability, but others tangibly impact the character's playstyle, and all of them lend a sense of escalation to every mission. In the competitive multiplayer, however, this system can unfairly stack the odds against players who actually need the most help. The better you play, the faster you're able to progress through the leveling tree, which of course makes you even more powerful. This generally isn't an issue in close matches, but when a round starts to get away from you, it can snowball into a lopsided thrashing that gets less and less fun for the losing side. While it may not be as important as the progression system or multiplayer modes, it's worth noting that Battleborn's writing is, by and large, excellent. The humor can occasionally produce forced, cringeworthy lines, but far more often, it's goofy, witty, and endearing, with a distinct voice that should be immediately recognizable for Borderlands fans. It won't appeal to everyone's tastes, but anyone can appreciate the deep well of one-liners that flavor both the campaign and, surprisingly, the competitive multiplayer. And while there isn't much of a narrative to speak of, the stylized cinematics that bookend the campaign are pretty spectacular. Battleborn's strong Saturday morning cartoon vibes might actually be the game's single most defining aspect. Outside of that consistent, permeating voice, the game feels like an elaborate patchwork of ideas that compete for attention without necessarily adding much to the experience. The combat is frantic and tense, but often feels samey and superficial. The in-match leveling works wonderfully in the campaign, but can become problematic in multiplayer. The varied cast of heroes adds longevity, but the game still feels relatively content light. With so many moving parts that never quite gel, I found plenty of things to love but just as much to feel confused by and ambivalent about.",Battleborn is a first-person shooter from Borderlands developer Gearbox Software.,7
14,Mike Mahardy,Everyone 10+,,Galak-Z: The Dimensional,"Aug 4, 2015"," Galak-Z is a game of tense moments and heavy decisions. Its first expansion The Void, to its detriment, is one long adrenaline rush from start to finish. Galak-Z's frenetic core mechanics are intact, but The Void has sacrificed much of what makes the game so great in the first place. The Void's main focus is its score attack mode. It thrusts you into the titular abyss as you fight through familiar enemies such as space bugs, pirates, and mercenaries, all in the interest of increasing your standing in online leaderboards. There is no actual end--as long as you survive, you continue. Galak-Z's Newtonian physics-based combat is still very much at play here. You can strafe, reverse, boost, and leap around groups of enemies within zero-gravity environments, and as is the case with the base game, these mechanics feel fantastic. There's a rough learning curve, but once you master your ship's weapons and thrusters--as well as its alternate mech form--the nuance of each skirmish creates an intricate kind of chaos. It combines tension and dynamism to form something exhilarating. The expansion's arenas are much more confined than those of the original Galak-Z, which encourage exploration through the innards of asteroids and abandoned space vessels. The Void's new linear locales are bordered on either side by a torrent of purple energy that's damaging to the touch--they create a more cramped feeling, and another layer of danger in this already uninviting world. They increase the need for spatial awareness in more ways than one, however. Not only do you want to avoid them--you can push unsuspecting enemies into the flames along the way. To further deviate from the base game's design, The Void offers a daily challenge with a specific set of ship upgrades and a preset level layout. By dictating which enhancements you'll have access to, and creating a level playing field for anyone attempting the mission, The Void lures you out of your comfort zone. One of these events focused on mech upgrades. As someone who usually focuses on ship combat, I felt more exposed, and more vulnerable, than ever before. And Galak-Z's structure is its defining trait. While many modern roguelikes always return you to the beginning upon death, Galak-Z allows for checkpoints at the end of each ""season."" That is, if you complete five missions in a row, you complete that season and unlock the next one. But die before you finish that chain of victories and you'll lose everything except your ship's upgrade blueprints. The Void delivers a fun new take on Galak-Z's formula, but relinquishes its exceptional structure. The Void, on the other hand, fails to deliver the same thrills its base game does. It offers a fun new take on the Galak-Z formula, but relinquishes its exceptional structure, and the engaging risk/reward system it creates. With the increased focus on score there's less of a compelling emphasis on survival. In its original form, Galak-Z isn't afraid to confront you with tough choices: should you venture off the beaten path in search of ship upgrades, or boost for the exit just to reach a checkpoint? Should you sneak by this group of enemies to maintain your health, or destroy them for currency, and increased survivability down the road? Galak-Z is exciting in the way it uses survival to drive its every aspect. The Void, though, is driven by leaderboard ranks. Strategic long term thinking isn't completely absent in the expansion--more upgrades means better combat abilities in later chapters, and therefore, more points. But in basing The Void largely on score-chasing, it removes the weight of my decisions, which used to be the main thing between me and permanent defeat. I stop to consider my options much less frequently now. Despite my complaints, it's hard to deny the sheer thrill of The Void: careening through space, leaping over a giant bug, and firing my last missile into a group of pirates before I speed toward the mission's evacuation point. The expansion may take a less engaging approach to survival, but it's still a frantic, intricate display of movement and reaction. The Void attempts to break ground of its own, and in some ways, it has. But the end result is weaker than the foundation it's built upon.",Galak-Z: The Dimensional is a hand painted intergalactic adventure that will take you to the ends of the universe to fight enemies in brand new ways.,8
15,Jason D'Aprile,Mature,8,Alienation,"Apr 26, 2016"," Housemarque has produced action games with an old school pedigree for years, but Alienation may be its most intense release yet. The epitome of the retro-style, overhead four-player shooter done up with new school technology, this is a game that clearly shows off the developer's skills at crafting intense action experiences. Alienation isn’t that far removed from Housemarque’s Dead Nation; the aliens you fight here frequently move in a zombie-like fashion. The overhead, isometric perspective and focus on team-based survival feel very familiar, too. However: the devil is in the details. There’s a decided focus on refinement over Housemarque's past games in Alienation. The world has been overrun by aliens, much of the population has either been killed or mutated, and the only hope for turning the tide rests upon a squad of four heavily modified soldiers. Levels have plenty of space to explore, with mission objectives that force you to scour maps from end to end. Exploring the game's side pockets and out of the way places is a rewarding pursuit, with items, weapons, and currency in abundance, allowing you to level up both your soldier and weapons in an RPG-like fashion. There are three distinct classes to choose from before you get started, each offering a different style of gameplay. The tank is just what you’d expect—big, bulky, and tough. He can generate shields and unleash massive bursts of energy for special attacks. At first, the saboteur seems like an odd choice for a decidedly non-stealth focused game, but he ultimately proves to be a valuable asset during coop. They can turn invisible and sneak past aliens, double dash, and unleash a devastating aerial bombing attack. Lastly, the bio-specialist is a valuable assist character that can heal teammates and choke enemies with clouds of poison. Alienation's three classes compliment each other well on a full team, with the tank taking the direct approach and shielding his teammates, while the saboteur handles outliers quickly, and the bio-specialist backs them up with healing and the poison cloud attacks that whittles enemies down. All three offer a range of upgrade options; every ability has an upgrade path with sub-choices that can be switched on the fly. You might opt for a slightly faster recharge rate for a special attack, or slightly more attack damage. As you progress, new weapons can be picked up from fallen enemies or scattered crates. When you acquire a new weapon, you can either equip or salvage it. Salvaging weapons rather oddly lets you “re-roll” the stats of your guns, so you can potentially get them powered up without actively adding upgrades to them. Housemarque's talent for delivering exceptional gunplay is on full display. There are shiny “cores” to pick up too, which allow you to increase the power levels of guns—everything from damage to clip size is modifiable. Since you can upgrade on the fly, the results of any re-roll or upgrade to your character or weapon are immediately noticeable, adding a huge boost of instant gratification to the leveling system. Each player’s loadout consists of three weapons—a primary, secondary, and heavy. In addition, there’s a grenade slot that recharges after each use and can include mines and a boomerang, among other destructive toys. Housemarque's talent for delivering exceptional gunplay is on full display; the shotgun has a satisfying oomph and the flamethrower's chaotic fountain of fire is a joy to unleash. Starting off in Alaska, Alienation moves you to places like Brazil, Russia, and onto alien ships. Depending on the number of players, difficulty level, and specific map, its 20 missions can each take anywhere from 20-30 minutes to nearly an hour each. You're given a variety of 'go here, scan this, kill that' type of objectives within each mission, but the appearance of random events helps mix things up--sudden boss battles or a horde of aliens can appear at a moment’s notice. These random events get deeper the farther you go and beating the game introduces new gameplay elements like special assignments, alien hideouts, mysterious artifacts, and other goodies. These extras do a great job of incentivizing you to dive back in. Though you can play Alienation on your own, it's absolutely focused on its online multiplayer. Levels get blisteringly hard after a while, even with a full team, and coordinated attacks can be a near-necessity later in the game. There are respawn points spread throughout the map where dead characters will respawn. Yet, the game is almost sadistic in its respawning of aliens. Dying means having to plow through whatever lost ground you suffered, which will be completely repopulated--frequently with more and tougher aliens. Alienation is a refined and intense shooter that looks and sounds great, and offers fantastically chaotic and violent action. There are a couple odd bits of frustration though. For one, Alienation only supports online multiplayer--local co-op has yet to be implemented. Another annoyance is that, even when playing alone, you can’t actually pause the game. Finally, Vita owners will find that the control scheme requires a lot of tweaking to be playable on the small screen. Alienation is a refined and intense shooter that looks and sounds great, and offers fantastically chaotic and violent action. While the game sometimes feels a little too eager to kill players and lacks local play, with a full troop online, it’s easily one of the best all-out action multiplayer games in recent memory.","From Housemarque OY, the creators of RESOGUN, Super Stardust: Delta, Dead Nation™ and Super Stardust HD, and XDEV Studio Europe comes ALIENATION, a next generation top-down action game, developed exclusively for the PlayStation4.",7.8
16,Justin Clark,Mature,7,The Magic Circle,"May 13, 2015"," The Magic Circle is another entry in the burgeoning but fascinating subgenre of games about the process of making games. Most games in that niche tend to aim small, often taking up the perspective of underdogs struggling to make tiny personal games in an industry filled with multimillion-dollar productions. The Magic Circle, on the other hand, aims big. It’s the product of AAA veterans, evidenced by some impressive technical wizardry, but also by the tone and timbre of its commentary, which pointedly deconstructs the egos of business types that tend to rip creativity up by the roots during big-budget game development. The titular Magic Circle, in-game, is an old-school series of text adventures whose reboot has been mired in development hell for years. It’s finally beginning to take shape as a triple-A, first-person, Skyrim-like RPG, but the creative direction of the game is being split three ways. The game’s original creator wants to go ambitious and artsy; the game’s creative director just wants to push out a game that will actually sell in the current landscape; a scheming, passionate intern with the support of the series' fanbase wants to put out a game that’s basically the original series, repackaged, and will do whatever it takes to see that happen. In the middle of it all is you, a lowly tester, forced to play a constantly changing rudimentary build, all while watching the creators float around the landscape, squabbling over the game’s minutiae. A playable demo is set to appear at a thinly-veiled version of E3 in mere days, and the creators are trying to push out something that will keep everybody happy, to virtually no avail. Their game is barely functional: the planned painterly landscape is still rendered mostly in black-and-white; creatures and objects lack proper behavorial programming; and the persistant remnants of a previous, cancelled build from the 32-bit era remain in place. One of the team's older testers, however, has decided to take action, and since you’re the only player with boots on the virtual ground, he grants you access to a few developer tools. Your task is to explore the unfinished game world in hopes of finding a way to lock the actual developers out of the game and craft something playable out of the mess. With the in-game creators calling the state of the unfinished build a disaster, the irony here is that it takes serious ambition and programming chops to render a game world like The Magic Circle, which has to come across as broken, lazy, and unfinished, but still functional enough to suit a playable fourth-wall breaking experiment. Despite a long initial load time, the fact that you can transition between three distinct aesthetics without so much as a stutter is truly impressive. But even then, not as impressive as the game’s bread-and-butter mechanic: the developer tools. You’re given the ability to recode the attributes of any object or enemy in the game, changing the names, movement, attacks, AI, and elemental weaknesses/affinities. The number of possible combinations allows for a lot of creativity. If you want to strip some of the mean little dog-like enemies of all their powers so they wander around aimlessly, you can. If you want to give a stationary rock the ability to walk and set its “Ally” setting to yourself so you have a literal pet rock following you around, you can do that. If you want to arm a bunch of spider-like enemies with laser rifles and the ability to fly, that’s also an option. Most of the fun of The Magic Circle stems from the sheer joy of experimentation, solving the game’s tricky environmental puzzles in an open-ended God Mode. That mandatory experimentation does have a tangible downside, though, as the game does a poor job of explaining how to weild your control over the world early on. There also a number of seemingly unintended technical issues. Reconfiguring attributes is a mechanic that feels like it would be far more suitable to control with a mouse and keyboard rather than a controller, as the UI for making edits can get terribly twitchy since the same button you use to jump is used to make selections on the edit screen. With automated characters getting stuck behind walls or turning invisible when there’s too many onscreen, there are glitches that you have to contend with. But none of these complaints are enough to dilute the overall joy of flexing your creativity as a virtual developer. Most of the games of this ilk tend to settle for being rather linear interactive narratives. The game is better for executing something new and distinctly enjoyable in how it ties its gameplay and story together. The only major disappointment is that there’s not enough of either. Only about half of the game is built around exploration and the edit function, though an extended climax does something unexpectedly magical with the idea. But even if you get meticulous about the endgame, The Magic Circle is on the short side, and just when the game truly settles into a groove, the narrative kicks into high gear and your time with the development tools is stripped away. Thankfully, the narrative is well-crafted, often funny, and salient about how much strife goes into even the smallest decision about a game’s design. The game’s storytelling apex is a five minute rant by the in-game Magic Circle’s creator about the impossible expectations of the industry, presented through an ingenius interactive gambit. There’s irony in the fact that the actual game’s greatest idea is eventually overtaken by an overambitious story, especially considering that one of the characters argues that the game’s audience doesn’t care about story to begin with. It’s hard to definitively say if The Magic Circle succesfully achieves its high-minded aims. Those expecting to play around with the physics of an open video game world will find themselves lamenting the lack of control and additional objectives after a short period of time, and those wanting nothing more than to find out where the narrative goes will be discouraged by how frustrating the gameplay can occasionally be. The essence of The Magic Circle is somewhere in between. As a piece of work meant to comment on modern game design, it’s wholly successful at creating a scenario perfectly illustrating just how Herculean a task it is for developers trying to create a game with a perfect balance.",,7.5
17,Cassidee Moser,Everyone,8,Soft Body,"May 17, 2016"," Soft Body is a playable kaleidoscope, an ever-changing symphony of motion, color, and sound. It’s a mixture of different genres, combining the best aspects of bullet hell games, puzzle games, and Snake to create a challenging and mesmerizing experience. You control two snakes that either move in unison or independently, dependent on the given level. The control inputs typically only require the left and right analog sticks. Using them, you guide snakes around a geometric landscape filled with angular enemies that emit waves of projectiles. You have to complete a collection of small objectives in order to beat each level, which usually involves moving a small ball or circular object around a maze, “painting” borders by touching or merely coming close enough to them, and destroying nearby enemies. The objectives remain simple and straightforward throughout, but the layout and challenges vastly differ from puzzle to puzzle. Despite their variance, none of the puzzles stray too far from Soft Body’s established rule set, and each design features the similar visual stylings and effects while also introducing new colors and contrasts. While minimal, Soft Body’s controls can be disorienting, particularly when you have to control each snake independently. It is a game of trial and error, requiring precision and careful navigation. In its worst moments, some puzzles devolve into a series objectives with no apparent connective tissue, including levels with two maze-like objectives located at opposite corners of the screen and divided by a large barrier that needs to be “painted” in order to complete the level. The void in between each of these objectives was basically a minefield of projectiles and enemies that felt added in for sheer navigational challenge alone and gradually grew more tiresome. These moments are rare, but their design still comes across as haphazard when compared to more organized levels whose puzzles follow a more logical flow. Tiny visual and aural flourishes breathe life into Soft Body's two-dimensional stages. When the snakes under your control come into contact with objects, particle effects spout onto the screen. When you complete your objectives, decorative background shapes spin and shake in excitement. These elements are enhanced by Soft Body's sound design, which is just as minimalist yet striking as the visuals, adding impact to each interaction between snakes and their environment. Every touch, hit, or movement around borders generates electronic chirps, and both the sights and sounds blend together to create a captivating, Zen-like experience. Visual and aural flourishes breathe life into Soft Body's two-dimensional stages. For such a bizarre, abstract game, Soft Body has a consistent visual language that communicates when and how enemies will act. Your foes take the forms of circles, squares, and triangles, each of which has a specific animation telegraphing its upcoming attacks. One circular “turret” latches its aim onto your snake and follows its movement for several seconds before the line representing its aim solidifies and the turret fires a projectile. Squares have a core that slowly swells toward the borders of the full shape, releasing a wave of deadly, circular projectiles once it reaches its edges. These enemies never break from Soft Body’s established rule set and language, making it consistent to solve despite its ever-changing presentation. Experimentation and identifying the reactions of the environment are essential to solving Soft Body’s puzzles, since new elements are sprinkled in throughout, often without any explanation. In one level, I saw a triangular border surrounding an enemy inside. Despite not having seen triangles in the game prior to that point, I swam up alongside it and discovered I could paint it to be my color. This speaks to the strength of a well-designed puzzle game: when the rules are consistent and the challenge is set up around that core rule set, solving puzzles remains satisfying in the long run. Soft Body embraces that concept while refusing to limit itself to being one predictable string of levels. Soft Body is captivating. It’s the fish tank to my inner cat, a fascinating display of methodical movement, clever sound, and unusually satisfying puzzle solving. It’s a minimalist, meditative arcade throwback whose simplicity sometimes backfires into chaotic design, but more frequently delivers challenging and beautiful puzzles.  ",Soft Body is an action/­puzzle game that infuses the twin­stick shooter with a surreal sense of control and style.,0
18,Mike Mahardy,,7,TASTEE: Lethal Tactics,"May 10, 2016"," In Tastee: Lethal Tactics, your plan is more important than the action that follows. It's a game of bets and bluffs, and if you telegraph your next move, you'll likely lose. Tastee doesn't always communicate its ideas effectively, and there are frustrating barriers to hurdle, but there's a tense, layered, turn-based strategy game waiting on the other side. It all revolves around simultaneous turn-based combat in two phases. In the planning stage, you direct the stance, movement, vision cones, and attacks of four individual mercenaries fighting your opponents. In the action phase, you watch your plan unfold--all while the enemy does the same. This forces you to think on several levels as you extract briefcases of money, defend control points, and eliminate enemy soldiers from an overhead view. You not only have to plan out your own attacks--you also need to consider the route your opponent might have in mind. So while your sniper may have one doorway covered, and your grenadier is ready to move around the corner of that building to get in position, this could all fall apart in the action phase if your opponent anticipated it. The resulting clashes are whiteknuckled displays of who saw the bigger picture in the planning phase. This structure isn't new--Tastee borrows from games such as Frozen Synapse and Laser Defense Squad, which use similar phase-based combat systems that emphasize careful planning over reactionary tactics. As was the case in those titles, you spend most of your time in the planning stage, your squad members frozen in place, trying to think two steps ahead of the opponent. Facing another human exacerbates the tension of the missions. Tastee's AI performs well, but matches become cutthroat poker games when you can relate to, and exploit, another player's perspective. Considering the numerous mechanical layers at play, and the nuance they display on each level, there's a steep learning curve to Tastee's combat. In fact, its tutorial only teaches the bare fundamentals of movement, aiming, and attacking before thrusting you onto the battlefield, either in multiplayer or the single-player missions. Because of Tastee's unforgiving difficulty--characters can die from only one bullet--most of your learning is based on trial and error. I spent almost two hours before I completed a mission without any casualties. The 30 single-player missions focus loosely on a band of 12 misfit mercenaries fighting against the drug cartels in a desert wasteland. The story is sparse and and repetitive, and serves mainly to introduce new characters, complete with unique abilities to use on subsequent missions: flashbangs, door breaches, ricochet grenades, and enhanced sniper rifles, to name a few. They're some of the game's best aspects, as they create stronger attachments to their respective owners. The loss of each soldier isn't permanent, but reverberates throughout the rest of your mission --losing a mercenary means losing a useful superpower, as it were. Augustus' Scout ability, for instance, lets you spot nearby enemies through the fog of war. If you can deduce which direction a soldier is running, and where he'll emerge from behind cover, you can set a sniper's sights on that exact spot. These abilities seem simple at first, but reveal deeper uses as you learn them. There are numerous mechanical layers at play at any one moment. Tastee's stellar map design is the catalyst for all of this planning and subsequent action. Missions span a variety of sandswept urban locales, from construction yards to abandoned shanty towns. Concrete walls funnel soldiers through choke points, wooden boards create complex sightlines, and low barriers provide opportunities for cover. The environments present a fine attention to detail, both in how they force your squad into precarious scenarios and how they allow you to master your surroundings. There's a sadistic thrill to circling your opponent's squad, eliminating them one by one, and setting up ambushes to stop their attempts at escape. Maps can become something of a conundrum, however. Tastee's bigger arenas play host to numerous smaller encounters and nuanced skirmishes, lending a sense of cohesion to the separate huts, garages, and gas stations. The problem is, these bigger maps add to the confusion that sometimes rears its head in Tastee. During the action phase, it's usually useful to zoom out from the map to see your overall plan unfolding. But the bigger the map, the less I understand the tactics of Tastee's world. There are more opportunities for distant snipers and random grenadiers to kill you on a whim. Often, I have no idea where I went wrong--what mistake sent things south. These sprawling locales are well designed in how they encourage tense individual encounters, but when they keep you at a distance from the action, it's hard to see what's happening on a minute level. The grasp I usually have on the tactical situation dissipates, leaving me confused. Tastee's user interface doesn't do it any favors either. Instead of crowding the edges of the screen, characters' abilities and commands manifest in an arc above their heads. While this streamlines the process of selecting a mercenary, giving them a chain of commands, and setting waypoints throughout the map, it leads to several more frustrations. For one, characters' selection boxes often overlap. In close-quarters battles, it's often tough to target the wrong character. Secondly, cancelling commands or waypoints is laborious, forcing you to parse through tiny buttons on a small list for sometimes minutes on end, in an effort to finalize your plan. Despite these annoyances, it's hard to deny the thrill of Tastee's firefights: moving your mercenaries into position, covering almost every sightline, worrying about that one you can't cover, and wincing as a shotgunner misses his target by a few inches--this is Tastee at its best. Tastee is also clever in the way it disguises its systems in order to teach you through experience. It's an intelligent, difficult game with a high barrier of entry, and without patience, you might not see how great it can be. But once you see the layers hidden beneath the surface, Tastee Lethal Tactics becomes an intricate game of cutthroat poker. It just takes a bit of frustration to buy in.    ","Strategy has a new name and it’s damn TASTEE. Recruit a team of volatile mercs and execute dramatic gunfights on a mission to take down the Cartel. Out think, outmaneuver, and eliminate enemies in a fresh take on simultaneous turn-based tactics. Precision planning meets epic action.",10
19,Daniel Starkey,,7,Stellaris,"May 9, 2016"," Serenity and wonder fill my ears when I first open Stellaris. Pulling from the same lived-in future aesthetic of games like Mass Effect, Stellaris opens with an invitation. It wants you to explore, it wants you learn, to unearth secrets your galaxy has held for millennia. As I do, astral outlines and nebulae dot my galactic map. Carved out into large chunks are the cosmos' remaining empires. The Kalaxenen Order. The Sibulan Core Worlds. The Bruggan Consciousness. And my own nascent superpower--the Reaper Commonwealth. We'd coexisted with our neighbors peacefully for centuries, but we were out of space and desperate for some breathing room. Our scientists yearned to comb through the rest of the galaxy's hyperspace lanes and long-forgotten ruins. And our priests were compelled to spread the will of the divine. So the galaxy erupted in war. War always seemed to follow me in Stellaris. That's partly because it's hard to expand indefinitely without frustrating someone, but also because there's a few hitches hiding within the layers of Paradox Interactive's latest grand strategy game. If you've ever played Civilization or any of its 4X descendants, you'll be familiar with Stellaris' basics. You helm a new civilization at the start of its journey. You can choose how they'll govern, what their guiding principles are, and how they'll develop technologically. If you choose to play alone, each of your opponents will have a randomly generated set of traits all their own- ranging from despotic fantastical pacifists to xenophobic materialists. Human players are just as likely to come up with creative personality combinations too. When you start a match, you're dipping your toes into an ocean of possibilities, eager to yield as your people explore and grow. That principle is reflected in Stellaris' pacing. Before locking down your starting solar system and working to build out its infrastructure, you'll scour neighboring stars for potential colony sites and resources. Then move in with settlers and engineers to start exploiting virgin territory. Along the way, you'll find all manner of long-lost technology, pre-industrial civilizations and other space-faring races. Each often comes with a ""quest"" line of sorts that develops into its own narrative thread. On one of my first planets, I discovered an advanced subterranean people. I had to decide upon a diplomatic strategy for them, whether I wanted to give them access to technology, and if I'd be willing to bail them out if they ran into trouble. It was a small piece of Stellaris, but my relationship with these people became one of my most valued. In time, they paid me back for all the favors I'd done, and supported the empire at large. But even if they hadn't, I felt connected to them. I caught myself roleplaying my interactions with them, trying to live up to my empire's own benevolent spiritual collectivist beliefs. It's this kind of ongoing, deterministic narrative scaffolding that forms Stellaris' backbone. Where most other strategy titles are content to focus on conquest and victory, Stellaris wants its relationships and the story you weave as your people grow to be the focus. That runs straight to the core of Stellaris, too. As you encounter new species, you'll be able to integrate them as citizens in your civilization. And you'll have to balance their prejudices and ideologies against those of your own citizens, decide whether they can vote, and even help them settle new planets that might be tough or inhospitable for your own race. These dynamics can have massive effects on intergalactic politics as well. If you enslave or purge (read: genocide) another race, other civilizations will remember your sins and hold centuries-long grudges. These dynamics start coming into play when you hit the mid-game. After you've got your basic group established, as your borders and those of your neighbors start grinding against one another, you'll have to find more creative ways to keep up the early game's strong momentum. If you're not careful, you can be boxed in by ancient and powerful civilizations. Grand strategy games often devolve into war at some point, but conflict with these giants is a quick path to eradication. Instead, it helps to build a multi-racial empire with several disconnected settlements. When one front stalls, you can push another and keep your populace moving so that there's always something to do and someone to manage. It also helps to play on a map with few other empires so you can grow a quite a bit before you start running into problems. It's not easy, and it's a bit strange that you have to finagle the game into maintaining a solid pace, but those problems also stem from some of Stellaris' best decisions, even though they don't always work out the way they should. For example, research in Stellaris works quite a bit different than in most 4X games. There's no static tree you climb, moving from agriculture to calendars and then to crop rotation. Instead you'll receive several ""cards"" from a deck of possibilities. Some, like sapient artificial intelligence, are rarer than others and represent major leaps forward in tech that can also help you break away from the pack. Others are weighted to show up more often to give everyone the same basic tools to start with. In theory, this keeps any one game from feeling too similar to any other. That works to a point, but it also means that you can pass up some critical piece of infrastructure tech and you might not see it for a while, or if you're unlucky, never again. It forces some tough decisions that, while engaging, don't always make sense. There doesn't seem to be any real reason that I have to lose out on colony ships for a better research facility. On balance, though it's a welcome change, and I got more out of it than I lost. Technology plays into galactic diplomacy as well. Some hyper-advanced civilization may find your development pathetic and offer to bring you under their wing as a protectorate, giving you major bonuses to research and a benevolent overseer that can keep you safe from the big bullies on the block--or at least try. The catch here, is that if you develop past a certain point, you become your overlord's vassal. With that, they can, in time absorb your civilization completely. Or, you can request--and likely fight--for your independence, often at a time when their resources are spread thin with another war or even a recession. It's here--with warfare and diplomacy--where Stellaris takes the most risks, and their payoffs can vary from match to match. Those with pacifistic civilizations might try to form strong bonds with others and form powerful peacemaking coalitions. Others will, no doubt, flex their muscles and conquer all the can. Bringing everything from psychic warriors and specially designed war ships to bear down on their foes. And while these two outlets for Stellaris' systems each work well on their own, their dependent upon so many of the game's other novelties that they don't fit together all the time. Stellaris is strange in that it wants you to play on its terms, but within that you have amazing latitude. The semi-random nature of research means that you won't always be able to guide your people to what they need. Plus, negotiating federations can be difficult when meeting new races depends upon you breaking out of your starting area--something that can sometimes be impossible if you're surrounded by super-hostile enemies. When it works, though, an alliance can help you leap ahead and match your elder rivals. Trade with someone who pities you can provide a massive influx of cash to fuel your economy, and, within short order you might have a diverse enough population to colonize a dozen or more extra planets. That, in turn, gives you more people to crew ships, drive research, and more complex internal politics to manage. But that's just it, it's based on chance. You can tilt things in your favor and increase the likelihood of a more exciting game, but that's never a solid guarantee. Stellaris is strange in that it wants you to play on its terms, but within that you have amazing latitude. Its emphasis on exploration is exhilarating. It makes each run feel inviting and special. But that doesn't always hold. Some games run through to the end and hit all the right notes at all the right times. Others are best left running in the background as you crunch for better technology so you can break free of your narrow corner in the galaxy. This could be helped if you could sneak, or stealth ships through enemy territory to colonize far-flung worlds. Or, if you could have finer control of research. Or, if you could overwhelm enemy fleets with superior tactics, despite a massive technological disadvantage. Instead, you're at Stellaris' mercy. It is fortunate then, that more often than not Stellaris doesn't just work, it excels, but that makes its breaking points feel that much more agonizing because it wouldn't have taken much tweaking to smooth them out.","Stellaris is a strategy game from Paradox Development Studio that has a deeply challenging system that rewards interstellar exploration as you traverse, discover, interact and learn more about the multitude of species you will encounter during your travels.",8.3
20,Peter Brown,Mature,8,DOOM,"May 13, 2016"," In Doom, I see a world brimming with demons, explosions, and hellfire. I see familiar faces screaming, with bloodthirsty eyes and unwavering stares. Playing it delivers the same cathartic craze the original Doom and Doom II did in the early '90s: overwhelmed by the horrors around every turn, but empowered with an impressive collection of weapons at the ready. But the new Doom is louder and faster than the old model. Its battles ask more of you, and its heavy-metal soundtrack causes your body to quiver from turbulent surges of adrenaline. From the outset two things are made immediately clear: you were born to kill demons, and you'll do anything it takes. You will wrench countless jaws from their joints and eviscerate the swollen flesh of your enemies between bouts of furious gunfire. These powerful moments carry what, at its core, is a simple game. The cadence of Doom's campaign is unwavering to the point of predictability as you make multiple round-trips between Mars and the depths of hell. Each location bears its own distinct but static identity, and your return trips inspire more deja vu than surprise as you tread familiar ground on either side of the dimensional portal you're charged with dismantling. You rarely take an unexpected turn, but any bothersome feelings this gives you are washed away the moment you enter battle. Doom equips you with a range of weapons that start simple and grow ever more elaborate. Not all are created equal, and there are some you will ignore for their lack of stopping power, but many are formidable, and a near constant stream of upgrades allows you to tweak your favorites in order to give them greater functionality and strength--more cause for attachment to, and wonder in, the power at your fingertips. This power extends to Glory Kills, Doom's contextual dismemberment techniques that can be triggered when you cause an enemy to stagger. They are the embodiment of gore fetishization, offering multiple ways to tear enemies into pieces, dependant on your angle of approach. Glory Kills are also strategically valuable. Enemies occasionally drop health items and ammo when felled by a gun, but you're guaranteed an injection of health when you flay your opponents using your bare hands--and occasionally with a body part of their own. This incentivizes you to rush in even when on the brink, offering hope at the end of a potentially deadly tunnel. Similarly, you also collect a chainsaw that can rip demons in half as a one-hit kill, which causes ammo to spout from their corpses. Your chainsaw requires precious fuel and should be used sparingly, and figuring out the best time to use it becomes a tense mind game of its own. The rhythm of combat--which almost always begins as a plainly presented lockdown in a room--grows increasingly hard and fast over the course of Doom's thirteen missions. Larger and more dangerous demons appear over time, and in greater numbers. As you weave and leap around maze-like arenas to improve your vantage and search for much-needed supplies, you function like a magnet, drawing enemies toward you. As you do, the once-disparate groups in an arena become concentrated. The effect of this is that you can put your explosive munitions to good use and inflict heaps of damage to multiple enemies at once. But there is a downside: you can quickly back yourself into a corner as you retreat. Despite this danger, herding enemies is par for the course in Doom as it's often the most viable tactic. This plays into the cyclical murderous bliss of Doom: round and round we go. The tension of facing increasingly durable enemies gives this system longevity despite its repetitiveness. Bipedal imps give way to towering, bloated monstrosities, powerful stampeding beasts, and disembodied flaming skulls. To keep up with the horde, you must use resources earned for your past feats to modify and upgrade your weapons with new capabilities. This steadily feeds into your brash and violent persona in order to maintain the high of combat in the face of your growing tolerance for all things brutal. Where a shotgun blast to the face was once satisfying and effective enough, you ultimately desire the thrill and power of unleashing a mortar-like cluster bomb from your double-barrelled best friend. When he's spent, you'll be thankful you upgraded your heavy assault rifle with micro-missiles that pierce the air with a subtle whistle before lodging under the skin of a demon and exploding, one after another. Where a shotgun blast to the face was once satisfying and effective enough, you ultimately desire the thrill and power of unleashing a mortar-like cluster bomb from your double-barrelled best friend. Upgrades can be earned by sweeping maps of demons, or discovered by exploring every inch of Doom's environments. Both techniques demand diligence. Secrets and hidden areas aren't new to Doom, but the variety of rewards you can reap are greater than ever. Every bit of hardware, including weapons, armor, and their underlying software, can be augmented in multiple ways. Nevertheless, you come across your fair share of upgrades even if you stay on the beaten path, and you'll probably want to as the thrill of combat gets under your skin. The process of awkwardly platforming your way across Doom's maps grows increasingly tiresome as your pulse drops to a murmur, and your patience for anything other than combat wears thin. The advent of Rune Challenges mixes this up a bit, offering self-contained tasks that momentarily take you out of missions and into tiny arenas where you need to defeat enemies under strict conditions. As enjoyable as these can be, they don't hold a candle to mission combat and eventually become an afterthought as you seek your next battle. When Doom funnels you from one location to the next, it introduces brief moments that tell your story, and the story of the energy-obsessed Union Aerospace Corporation. It's the UAC's ill-conceived decision to tap into Hell's energy resources that created the portal between dimensions in the first place, and though you are an agent of the UAC in a way, yours is a reluctant enlistment. The tale of your involvement carries a certain gravitas in the way it speaks of legends and dark messiahs, but it ultimately amounts to little more than window dressing to justify your actions. When your journey comes to a close, you will have spent close to a dozen hours in the thick of it, the last of which are punctuated with riveting boss fights and seemingly impossible odds. With a flush arsenal and enhanced physical abilities, you may opt to return to previous missions and find items you may have missed, or lay waste at higher difficulty levels, but multiplayer awaits those who seek something new. Apart from a few multiplayer-exclusive weapons and the ability to play as demons during portions of a match, there's actually very little new about Doom's multiplayer. Its modes are few, delivering the expected assortment of match types, including team deathmatch and domination challenges, and a couple fun diversions like freeze tag. By and large, you won't find much in multiplayer that hasn't been done before, but what's there is enjoyable in small doses thanks to the fast pace of combat and the explosive nature of Doom's weaponry. Doom is straightforward and simple, but it serves its purpose: to thrust you into increasingly dire scenarios fueled by rage and the spirit of heavy metal. More impressive than multiplayer is Snap Map, a mode that allows you to create and share both multi- and single-player maps online. Tutorials walk you through the steps involved in creating a map, which is intuitive to begin with. Beyond ease-of-use, Snap Map will live or die through the creativeness of the community, which has already made a strong showing, delivering a range of maps that range from brutal to absurdly entertaining. More than multiplayer, Snap Map is the cherry on top of the new Doom. But without a doubt, the loud and chaotic campaign is Doom's strongest component. It's straightforward and simple, but it serves its purpose: to thrust you into increasingly dire scenarios fueled by rage and the spirit of heavy metal. Many shooters chase the thrill Doom delivers, but few are as potent in their execution. It captures the essence of what made the classic Doom games touchstones of their day, and translates it to suit modern palates with impressively rendered hellscapes and a steady influx of tantalizing upgrades. Doom is the product of a tradition as old as shooters, and while it's not the model to follow in every case, modern shooters could learn a thing or two from Doom's honed and unadulterated identity.",Doom (stylized as DOOM and originally known as Doom 4) is the upcoming multi-platform installment of the Doom series by id Software,8.5
21,Scott Butterworth,Mature,5,Homefront: The Revolution,"May 17, 2016"," Somewhere within Homefront: The Revolution--beneath the choppy framerate, the hackneyed narrative, and the half-explored mechanics that are hastily introduced then forgotten just as quickly--exists a solid, cinematic shooter. All the ingredients are there. It casts players as American resistance fighters--outmanned and outgunned, but resourceful and resilient--which naturally paves the way for both novel gameplay and daring political themes. Unfortunately, Homefront doesn't quite deliver on either one. Its attempts to explore those political themes feel clumsy and superficial. Its mechanics embrace the scrappy nature of guerilla combat, but technical shortcomings generally force you into rudimentary run-and-gunning. The lengthy story campaign packs plenty of impressive moments that make good on the promising premise, but the game's myriad flaws turn what could have been a thrilling yet thoughtful shooter into a derivative, mediocre also-ran with serviceable shooting and plenty of unrealized potential. If there's one thing Homefront absolutely nails, however, its variety. The game's near-future version of an occupied Philadelphia is broken into eight districts, each of which is large, open, and dotted with dozens of ambient tasks like outposts to capture and supply caches to uncover. While these activities remain largely the same throughout the game, the districts themselves vary both visually and in the play style they demand. The first area I experienced was basically an open war zone filled with bombed out buildings and on-going firefights. But later on, I found myself in a tranquil, tree-lined district where unholstering a weapon at the wrong time could mean instant death at the hands of watchful, well-armed security officers. Homefront also never cuts corners when it comes to world building. When I was sent to hijack a super weapon, I got to see it in action and revel in the volley of explosions. When the occupying army ordered blimps to gas the entire city, I saw blimps overhead as green fog filled the streets. And anytime my crew of resistance leaders needed to organize a new plan, there was a full (albeit unskippable) cutscene displaying the debate. Homefront never leans on empty exposition; it actively shows you the world and events surrounding the gameplay, and that, combined with the varied districts, imbues the campaign with an unexpected richness. Unfortunately, the story stringing it all together fails on several counts. Most notably, there's no relatable hero, no substantial plot development, and no discernable villain beyond the faceless, undeveloped occupying army. You never see or hear protagonist Ethan Brady, and none of his actions imply any kind of personality. He's purely an empty vessel, and while that's fine, there's not enough other story substance to fill the void. There are three characters that stick with Ethan all the way through, but you only interact with them between missions as they lament the latest setback. While I did develop some connection to my comrades, most of their dialogue was trite action movie banter. Homefront never leans on empty exposition; it actively shows you the world and events surrounding the gameplay, which imbues the campaign with an unexpected richness. The minimal plot is similarly generic. There's no real arc to the narrative; rather, each new story beat is just another excuse to send you on an errand in the name of gaining some ground for the resistance. This feeling of running in circles stems, at least in part, from the absence of an obvious villain. Not every story needs a Darth Vader, but even the game's most important adversary--the fictional Korean People's Army--remains an entirely abstract entity throughout. You never once hear a KPA officer speak. You're never given any insight into their mindset. All you know about the KPA is you're fighting them, and frankly, it's hard to feel motivated to destroy an enemy you know nothing about--especially when the characters you're intended to empathize with constantly spout a thinly veiled racial slur. Homefront's mechanics don't do the campaign justice either. As a resistance fighter faced with impossible odds, it makes sense you'd rely on stealth and subterfuge, and while the game attempts to accommodate that approach, it also constantly undermines itself. The biggest issue is simply the inconsistency of detection. More than once, I was spotted while fully concealed behind a wall. Other times, I would open fire on one guard only to round a corner and find another guy blissfully unaware of the gunshots that rang out just moments before. Because you can never be sure if your attempts at stealth will actually work, it's generally not even worth trying. But even if you're seriously committed to sneaking, Homefront may not be able to satisfy your inner Solid Snake. Though you're given some helpful tools like diversion-creating firecrackers, certain essential stealth mechanics--like the ability to hide bodies--are missing. Other tools, while helpful in theory, end up being kind of pointless. You can tag enemies using your smartphone's camera, for example, but enemies (and their vision cones) are almost always visible on your mini-map, so why bother? The most effective stealth technique I discovered: awkwardly sprinting away from anyone who's awareness meter was starting to fill. That just leaves combat, which is unremarkable but still enjoyable. The core shooting mechanics prove satisfying, with reasonably responsive aiming, punchy sound effects, and gruesome enemy death animations. Thankfully, enemies are not bullet sponges, so a few well-placed shots will reward you with an easy kill. You'll also have to contend with armored vehicles and attack drones, but these end up being a welcome sight, not only because they naturally escalate the tension of any conflict but also because they're immensely satisfying to take down with a makeshift bomb or hijack with a hacking device. More than once, I was spotted while fully concealed behind a wall. Other times, I would open fire on one guard only to round a corner and find another guy blissfully unaware of the gunshots. The crafting and currency systems--which allow you to create those bombs and hacking tools--are relatively simplistic, but they do allow you to unlock some memorable weapons later on, including a tactical crossbow and jerry rigged mine launcher. You can also modify all your weapons on the fly, adding attachments or swapping major components to convert, say, your pistol to an SMG. In practice, it's not hugely different from simply selecting gear from a radial menu, but it at least fits Homefront's themes. Weirdly, you can also find mechanics that seem almost abandoned or incomplete. For example, the game never mentions it, but I discovered you can approach allies and recruit them to follow you into battle. Doing so doesn't fundamentally alter the gameplay, but...it's there. This particular mechanic, though strangely superfluous, might have added more to the experience if Homefront's enemy and ally AI were stronger. Currently, their behavior is unpredictable at best. Some enemies would smartly head for cover during firefights while others would mindlessly run towards me despite the pile of dead bodies practically blocking the doorway. Unfortunately, spotty AI isn't Homefront's only technical problem--far from it. You can find rough edges basically everywhere you look, and on all three platforms (Xbox One, PC, and PS4). The screen freezes momentarily each and every time the game autosaves. The framerate is inconsistent, frequently dipping slightly and occasionally stuttering egregiously. The audio sometimes stumbled as well, blasting tense music during non-combat moments or cutting out when a character is speaking. I also encountered several random difficulty spikes and respawn locations that placed me perilously close to the fray. These issues also extend to the game's co-op component, which is separate from its story campaign. Visually, it can't compare to the decent-looking solo mode, but worse still, it offers an anemic amount of content: six 10- to 15-minute missions. You can select any of three difficulty levels, but the objectives and map layouts don't change, meaning the only reason to replay the missions is to challenge yourself. There is a loot crate system that allows you to randomly unlock gear from the campaign, but you'll have beaten all six missions long before you get lucky enough to acquire the equipment you want. Ultimately, co-op adds little to the overall package, which is a shame since Homefront definitely needs some help. Its substantial story campaign is impressively rich and its shooting can be tense and fun, but half-baked stealth, an unfulfilling story, and a vast menagerie of technical inadequacies drag the overall experience into disappointing mediocrity.",Homefront: The Revolution throws players into a near future dystopia where catastrophic events have brought the United States to its knees and enabled the Korean People's Army forces to impose a brutal military occupation.,5.1
22,Daniel Starkey,Teen,9,Total War: WARHAMMER,"Apr 28, 2016"," Screeching gears, rhythmic boot steps, and the soft crunch of fresh snow. These were the first notes of my invasion. I sought the Dwarfen capital of Karak Varn. The Dwarfs, hardy and resilient though they may be, were a thorn for my new allies, the green-skinned Orcs and goblins. I held my siege for weeks, and while my foes’ numbers dwindled, mine grew. After each clash, I wrenched the newly dead from the earth and added them to my fiendish, Vampire hordes. Siege engines ready, and carried yon by fresh Dwarfen zombies, I steeled my undead warriors for the final assault. When the battle started, I surrounded my enemy's commander with Vargheists--monstrous, man-eating bats--and sent battering rams for the gates. But that wasn't enough, not nearly. Dwarfs are hardy. They rarely break ranks or flee in terror no matter how ferocious their opponent. I needed more. When the gates broke, I rushed in with ethereal cavalry, immune to normal weapons and equipped with scythes that bypassed even the sturdiest armor. In minutes, my ghastly corps had torn through Karak Varn's defenders. This was Warhammer, and this was Total War. The Total War series has, until now, balanced historical realism with strategic play. During campaigns (which you can play either alone or with others) you’ll refine your statecraft, research technology, and manage your economy to keep your armies well-supplied. All this takes place on a continent scaling political map detailing borders, important landmarks and troop detachments. Should two opposing forces meet, the game will pull in to show the skirmish. Here, you’ll micromanage movement and use battlefield tactics to out maneuver foes. Your decisions and political position throughout the game would have major effects on the sorts of troops and supplies you could field for any given battle. Warhammer, however, has always been about tactics, and for more than 30 years, it's been one of the most popular fantasy settings around, with a rich lore and vibrant tournament scene for its tabletop miniature game. Mixing the two raised a lot of questions about how Creative Assembly's attentiveness to historical detail would work with vampires, demons, and magic. But, the result is a sight to behold. Not only is it one of the most faithful adaptations of Warhammer's mythos, it is also far and away the best Total War has ever been. That is, in no small part, due to the natural marriage of Warhammer as a setting and Total War's gameplay as a foundation. While troop movements and formations have always been an essential part of Total War, you were always playing with human beings as your pawns. That foundation in real-world history kept the series somewhat limited. Yes, it was a joy to see elite Celtic warriors square off against Caesar's legions, but there are only so many ways those fights can go. Warhammer shakes that up in a big way. With the addition of irresponsibly large cannons, apparitions, gyrocopters, and powerful spells, the amount of time you need to spend learning what you and your foes can bring to bear on the battlefield is staggering. But it's worth it. Skirmishes are an artful dictation with two (or more) minds jockeying for control, prodding weak points, breaking lines, and exploiting new fronts of attack. These fights don't get old. Total War: Warhammer is an interlocking network of smart decisions. Integrating the Warhammer universe with Total War's systems was the first of these. Part of that comes from how distinct all of the main factions are. The Empire is a Roman-esque monolithic force. They're organized, effective generalists. Bretonnians, an Arthurian band of humans, use pegasi and holy lances to cleanse evil. The Greenskins pull from Warhammer's own brand of classic fantasy orcs and goblins. Silly, obnoxious, and blood-thirsty, they come with complex internal politics. If you're not waging enough war, measured by a stat called ""fightiness,"" other factions will sprout and make with the killing that you haven't. Vampire Counts are a genuine undead faction. They bolster their lines by draining life from others and reviving the dead from massive battles. They can swarm the field with countless warriors and can even raise more midway through a bout. In exchange, their units usually fall apart. They will never run in fear, though; instead, they crumble as their will to press on after death fades. Dwarfs are their opposite, with heavily armored and armed troops. They pull in staunch defenders that will hold a battle line long enough for their enemies to be ripped to shreds with machine guns and cannon fire. Like its tabletop namesake, Total War: Warhammer balances these disparate forces well. Each faction has a bevy of gameplay options that mesh, but there is no one right way to play--leaning into their strengths and mixing it up with the occasional oddball tactic works here. That's supported with magic, which can turn the tide of all kinds of fights. From chasing down an opposing lord and sapping his life with a Vampiric curse to causing an enemy unit to chafe and itch, magic augments formations and movements and only ever broadens your scope of tactical choices. Because most magic users are lords and heroes, this also means your leaders play a critical role in battle. They can often handle entire battalions on their own, and when you lose one, it's much more akin to losing a queen in chess than a beefed-up soldier. While protecting a lord was important in prior games, now it's vital, and maneuvers tend to reflect that. Because of their strength, it's advantageous to have them at or very near the front lines. So you're faced with a choice in how you protect the lord and maximize his potential without risking a loss. That, in turn, influences your other choices. As the Vampires, do you want to take ethereal cavalry and press against enemy lines thereby leaving your often less-than-mobile lord undefended? Or, based on the spells you've taken to battle, will you charge in with your leader, summon a few squadrons of zombies to hold your foe, and sweep with your support units? Your choices are augmented and modified by everything else at play--such as the terrain, which you can use for surprise attacks--as well as the minutiae of your foe's plans. Everything matters, and every choice has an impact. Campaigns throw even more variables into that mix. Like previous Total War games, you can take command of a country and balance your strategies (economic, cultural, etc.) and your tactics (individual battles). Here things go from beautifully intricate to elaborate master stroke. Each of the four major factions (that is Empire, Vampires, Greenskins, and Dwarfs) have their own campaigns with major battles, quests, and goals. Unlike previous Total War games where you'd have a smattering of small distinctions to separate each group, these races are distinct. Vampires are reviled by the living (for good reason) and have a hard time with diplomacy. To survive and remain stable, they have to poison and corrupt the land. Dwarfs and Greenskins can travel underground, and have constructed settlements that only they can capture. The Empire is all about forming tight diplomatic bonds and working together with the other nations of men. Collectively, each of these groups is preparing for the coming Chaos--an absolute evil corrupting force that marches from the north. The Warriors of Chaos have some of the most powerful and devastating units. They also spread their own corrupting force, which can, on its own, cause rebellion and terror in living and unliving empires alike. Again, each of these pieces works together and helps texture the overarching narrative. At first, these races push their own petty agenda. But as the Game of Thrones-y threat grows in the north, you can try to band together with the others and hold off the impending invasion. At the same time, you'll have proximal, race-dependent goals for victory, which strain how you'll manage these larger threats. Vampires, for example, not only have to help stop the Chaotic onslaught, but also conquer the Empire and spread their vampirism. And holding off one monstrous, powerful foe while chipping away at your so-called allies is no easy task. As the campaign progresses, you'll have to manage multiple conflicts on many fronts, putting your skills to the test. Taken together, the campaign is brilliant insofar as it forces your hand and pushes you to take bigger risks, which, in turn, taxes your abilities as a tactician. As with many similar games, armies require upkeep, but in Total War: Warhammer, many of these are expensive. It's often more advantageous to build up rather than out. You can fortify and hold, but after a while, you'll need to start pushing back. Doing that means pulling soldiers away from your main settlements, opening up holes in your defenses that other races will be quick to exploit. Managing that conflict becomes a core concern in the late game, and it's a stellar way to test your mastery of your race's key traits. The campaign is brilliant ... it forces your hand and pushes you to take bigger risks, which, in turn, taxes your abilities as a tactician Total War: Warhammer is an interlocking network of smart decisions. Integrating the Warhammer universe with Total War's systems was the first. Massive battles are more challenging because of the addition of magic and flying units, which can flank and break battle lines if you're not attentive. New brands of artillery and different types of units are engaging and keep you changing up your approach. Total War: Warhammer has also seen a massive upgrade to its AI. Where before you might see a AI opponent rush you when you had strong defensive position, now the CPU will employ advanced flanking maneuvers, or use cavalry to pull away key defenders. Audio design too has picked up an interesting overhaul. The Total War series has always had excellent sound effects that help sell the scope of its battles--especially with a base heavy system and a camera zoomed down to the troop level. But here it’s even more noteworthy because of the fantasy elements at play. We know what a Roman gladius striking a rawhide shield sounds like. We can create that sound here in the real-world. But what about Dwarfen organ guns? What about the off-kilter shuffle of Orcish armor? There’s no proper equivalent, and that goes for the Vampire Count's monstrosities and the demons that form the ranks of the Warriors of Chaos. In every case, these combatants sound glorious. Everything here hasn't just been improved, it's been damn near mastered. Total War has always been about balance--between strategy and tactics, realism and engaging play. Warhammer's characters, its history, and its creativity is a shot in the arm for a series. My complaints from a few years ago with Total War II's camera still hold. When pulling the camera out to get a better view, you can’t go very far before the game switches to a full overhead view. That be somewhat troublesome and limit how much of any give battle you can see at once, but it’s a minor frustration. When you're in the middle of a siege and you're coordinating an assault with a friend, Total War: Warhammer approaches perfection. You’ll be tested on all fronts and asked to manage complex battles with broad, nuanced outcomes. Every system and piece feeds into others, and your choices make all the difference. It's a triumph of real-time strategy design, and the best the Total War series has ever been.  ","Total War: WARHAMMER will take the series to a realm of grand high fantasy for the very first time in its history. Our rules have changed, and with change comes war on a scale as yet unimagined.",8.2
23,Alex Gilyadov,Mature,7,Party Hard,"Aug 25, 2015"," After a long day of work, you come home exhausted, make yourself dinner, take a quick shower, watch some television or play a video game. Then you try to get some sleep. After a few unsuccessful hours of tossing and turning, it’s already 3AM. You lie in your bed wide awake. The massive college party next door, with its obnoxious electronic music, isn't letting up. Do you complain? Do you call the cops? Nope. Instead, you put on a hockey mask, grab a butcher’s knife, and kill everyone at the party. The premise for Party Hard is disturbing. You play as a psychopath, Darius, who goes on a nationwide killing spree just because he can’t get any sleep. Darius seeks out the biggest parties around the United States, repeatedly stabbing and beheading people left and right. But developer tinyBuild sprinkles much-needed levity and dark humor throughout--Party Hard, thankfully, doesn’t take its premise seriously. Party Hard plays from a top-down perspective, and is separated into several types of parties. Each level consists of five or six different areas, from kitchens and bedrooms, to private VIP balconies and dance floors. Your objective is always the same--kill everyone at these parties without getting caught by the police. Beyond taking out partygoers with your knife, there are several different ways of getting the job done: you can also set off traps, and have other people kill for you. Setting rooms on fire, poisoning people’s drinks and food, and rigging dance floors with bombs are a few colorful options. During one level inside a famous Los Angeles nightclub, I was able to summon a UFO. A few aliens started abducting people for me while I hid backstage. In another level, on a boat party in Miami, I dispatched a smoke bomb, which allowed me to quickly stab a group of people while remaining hidden. Party Hard is slowly paced, requiring you to constantly strategize and analyze your surroundings. Rushing in, and killing people without any thought and care put into your attacks will likely get you caught. This slow nature reflects Darius' disturbingly dispassionate nature. He wants to enjoy every one of his murders and leave the crime scene without any trace. It's challenging and enjoyable to plan your kills, and make full use of your environments. Party Hard is like a deadly game of cat and mouse, always testing your ability to adapt and observe. Should I carry this drunk person to a hidden bush? Should I set the kitchen on fire now, or wait for more people to come in? Will I able to kill all four of these stragglers before someone spots me and calls the police? The levels are well designed and visually distinct, giving you enough room to breathe while also making it difficult to slip away unnoticed. The LA night club level, for example, has a pair of hidden stairs that allow you to swiftly move from the kitchen, all the way to an abandoned alley on the other side in mere seconds. But be wary of an eccentric man dressed as Mario at this nightclub, because he'll demolish the stairs if you use them too much. But for everything Party Hard gets right mechanically, it suffers from being repetitive. It's a shallow affair. While the first few levels are engaging, they introduce everything Party Hard has to offer. In every level there are always the same traps and items you can utilize, and the overreliance on your knife grows monotonous. I spent a lot of time waiting for people to fall asleep, or for them to move to an isolated area. When cops give chase, they can easily be exploited by employing basic tactics. I quickly found out that circling large fences, pools, and stages confuses the AI, forcing the cops to give up after a few seconds. Party Hard employs a beautiful neo-noir, pixel-art aesthetic and ‘80s soundtrack. It's similar to Hotline Miami, with heavy doses of purple and pink. The parties are frenetic spectacles replete with neon lights, eccentric character designs (the aliens look pleasingly weird), and plenty of blood and gore. The pixel-art visuals are another source of levity, as everything looks a bit fantastical. The folks you're killing are pixelated messes, without any facial details. This layer of abstraction is needed for a game about murdering innocent people. The up-tempo, funky soundtrack juxtaposes the slow gameplay, and there's a great variety of tunes for every party. Party Hard also tells a story of a detective chasing after Darius, with short cutscenes sprinkled in between each level. Both the writing and voice acting are awful, but they successfully come off being intentionally bad. It complements Party Hard’s silly tone and premise, and thankfully, storytelling isn’t the game’s focus. Your entertainment will come from planning deadly attacks in outlandish scenarios and environments. There’s enjoyment to be had with Party Hard’s dozen or so levels, despite the game’s lack of imagination in its later stages. It’s a wacky, bloody affair that never aspires for more.  ",,6.5
24,Miguel Concepcion,Mature,5,Shadow of the Beast,"Dec 31, 2015"," Those of us who read our game manuals cover to cover in the '80s were often treated to verbose backstories that help set the scene. These introductions provided context that was often missing within the game, and a deeper understanding of the hero’s motivation. In its modern reimagining of Shadow of the Beast, Heavy Spectrum brings one of these decades old text descriptions to life. To finally witness the premise of the Psygnosis classic in modern, animated cutscenes is to also explore the creators’ disturbing and inhumane vision. It is of a kidnapped human baby subjected to experiments, trained to be a thoughtless killer, and ultimately transformed into a veritable beast. The beast, Aarbron, begins the game by helping his master Zelek hunt for another infant subject. In doing so, Aarbron subsequently learns of his true past and proceeds to lash out, severely wounding his master in the process. It turns out that cutting Zelek without finishing him off was a mistake--Zelek throws his blood on the ground in order to summon minions throughout the game. Even though this isn’t a scene-for-scene remake of the original Shadow of the Beast, this new version retains the original’s then-unusual mix of linear and exploratory sections. It’s more segmented this time, where each area is self-contained. Today's Shadow of the Beast leans into the allure of replay incentives, including hidden areas, expanded narrative moments, and medal ranks for each encounter. Within each chapter is a set series of fights, with exploration sections serving as the connective tissue. Combat plays out like a puzzle of space management, where you have to deal with two processions of would-be assailants--enemies pour in from both sides of the screen at once. You soon learn that you have to be simultaneously efficient, and aware of each enemy's specific weaknesses. It's difficult to cope with being attacked from two sides at once, especially when engagements can involve as many as 30 enemies. Later in the game, some are impervious to certain attacks and it becomes a tiresome process of figuring out a foe’s specific weak point to get the job done. Like a poorly designed fighting game, there are ways to exploit certain fights by repeatedly using the basic attack, while there are other instances where the same foes are inexplicably invincible during particular frames of animation. This can easily put you in a combat mindset where you hope for the best rather than go in confident that your knowledge and skills will be sufficient. The substandard controls also extend to the platforming sections, where every leap feels sluggish. It’s the kind of mild irritation that isn’t pronounced until you fail a platforming sequence and have to repeat it multiple times to get it right. Aarbron is also gifted with wall running abilities, which is needed for the mainline paths. What’s frustrating are the advanced moves, particularly when you’re trying to run up a wall immediately after missing a jump. Even if you think you hit the climb button at the right time, you can still fail. For every environmental puzzle that makes you feel smart in Shadow of the Beast, there’s another that demands the kind of obtuse thinking that doesn’t feel rewarding. You can lose a dozen lives and half an hour trying to navigate through a nearly pitch black area only to realize that you had to take another path first to find an illumination device. Having direct access to the original game as an unlock is a blessing, if only to revisit the preposterous and quaint enemy designs within. From self-propelled rocks to obese bats, one couldn’t help but laugh at the charming diversity of the bestiary from 1989. There’s more cohesion and consistency in the remake's bestiary, with some room made for the original creatures to get an update. Large bosses played a meaningful role in the original game so it’s not surprising that similarly-sized gatekeepers would appear. One of the more memorable foes spends the majority of a chapter chasing and taunting you in the background before the actual battle. It’s a menacing sequence and one of the game’s few highlights. Shadow of the Beast also comes with a stacked social component, built on the premise that you will be motivated to replay chapters upon seeing friends’ scores in the leaderboard and their various accomplishments through the in-game live feed--a big ask, given the disappointing platforming and combat. There's also a button-mashing mini game where you can try to dismember and decapitate your colleague’s beast in a race against time. The novelty of this Mortal Kombat-style brutality--and the satisfaction of beating friends’ times--wears out quickly. From the visuals to the strict adherence to the original game's story, this reimagining is not bereft of fan service. Its failings come from the features one doesn’t associate with the series, such as the social hooks and the segmented structure of the world. The well-intentioned replay incentives are nearly rendered irrelevant by pedestrian level designs and rough combat. For a remake, it's not a good sign that the best part about the modern Shadow of the Beast is revisiting the game that inspired it.",Shadow of the Beast is an action adventure game where you seek to dethrone the evil lord Maletoth.,7.2
25,Mat Paget,Teen,6,Hitman GO,"Apr 17, 2014"," Hitman Go is an excellent example of a game that takes core elements from a franchise and turns them into something wholly different, while feeling through and through like it belongs. As you solve its puzzles, you feel like you're making your way towards an assassination target, completely undetected. It's marvelous how a simple and engaging puzzle game can be nothing like its precursor yet maintain a similar spirit. It's something that carries over to virtual reality but isn't helped by it--instead, it makes a poor case for why you should play it in VR at all. Hitman Go is presented like a board game, where you move an Agent 47 piece around the board, trying not to get caught in an enemy piece's path. You eliminate enemies like you would pieces in chess while making your way to the marked destination. Each level has three objectives: one is always to slip past the level's enemies and make it to the end, while the other two can be anything from completing it within a certain number of turns, grabbing an inconveniently placed briefcase, or making it through without killing anyone. Cleaning up every objective often requires you to play through the level more than once, and although not every level is as good as the last, figuring out the solutions is enjoyable enough in most of the levels to make them worth visiting a second or third time. Hitman Go also does a great job of introducing new concepts as it progresses. New tools that help you get through Agent 47's covert operations--such as sniper rifles and Agent 47's signature Silverballers--are brought in, but you'll also go up against new enemies, typically right when you think you've got everything figured out. By taking what you've already learned about an enemy and throwing in a new variation with a different set of behaviors, Hitman Go remains engaging throughout. Unfortunately, VR doesn't add anything of import to playing Go in VR. You're sat inside a bland room where the lighting changes on occasion--hardly an interesting addition or reason to play Go in VR. It's kind of cool being able to get a closer look at certain levels, but it's in no way impressive. With movement based on your perspective, controls can sometimes be finicky and frustrating, too. You control your piece with the left stick, moving it in the desired direction to slide Agent 47 across the board. However, as you move your piece away from its original position, the directions will change if your perspective stays the same. Moving your piece up now requires you to move the stick diagonally, as that's how it now appears to you. You can change your perspective by moving your head or sliding the board around with the right stick, but pushing up on the left stick and watching Agent 47 stand still makes the game feel unresponsive. On top of that, there were times when I felt a little bit motion sick after rotating the board close to myself. It was never anything major, but it was definitely noticeable. Virtual reality requires a commitment: you need to put aside time to put the headset on and cut yourself off from the world. Unfortunately, Hitman Go VR doesn't provide enough of an escape to make it worth the extra hassle. It's also a game that works better in short bursts, and VR headsets aren't always the quickest and most convenient things to jump in and out of. And no matter what device you play it on, whether it be on PC with an Oculus Rift or an Android phone with Gear VR, you have a device that can play the non-VR version of the game, which is almost the exact same experience. Additionally, Hitman Go VR doesn't offer a non-VR option--if you buy this version, the only place you'll be playing it in is virtual reality. Hitman Go VR feels unnecessary. It's an excellent puzzle game, but it's already available on a bunch of different platforms where it plays very well; the non-VR versions will be enough to enjoy everything Hitman Go has to offer. Solving its puzzles is as satisfying and enjoyable as eliminating a target without getting detected, but the VR version shouldn't be your first choice to experience them.

26,Mike Mahardy,Teen,9,Overwatch,"May 23, 2016"," Overwatch is an exercise in refined chaos. There are multitudes of layers hiding beneath the hectic surface, and they emerge, one after another, the more you play. This is a shooter that knows how to surprise, one that unfolds at a frantic pace, one that takes a handful of great ideas, and combines them into something spectacular. At first glance, it's a simple formula: two teams of six vie for control of mobile payloads, capture points, and key strategic positions. Each of its four modes are easy to grasp, serving as the foundation for the various maps and the powerful heroes colliding within them. That apparent simplicity is deceiving, though. Overwatch is an amorphous, shapeshifting organism that mean different things for different players, depending on which hero you choose, and what role you assume within the context of your team. The quality of Overwatch, as a hero shooter, relies on its fighters. And these 21 heroes, both in terms of personality and design, compose one of the more distinct and diverse casts in recent memory. Their dialogue hints at relationships among the group. Their art design conveys a stark visual vocabulary. Their abilities set the stage for multidimensional firefights with explosions, energy shields, and bursts of sonic energy. There's an enticing balance between mastering one character and trying someone completely new. Each of these characters could be the center of their own game. There's the dwarf engineer Torbjörn and his upgradeable defensive turret. There's the ape scientist Winston, with both superior intellect and animalistic rage. Then there's Tracer, the British pilot removed from the rules of space and time, warping around the battlefield and reversing her actions to correct mistakes she might have made seconds before. Like Tracer, Overwatch functions as a sort of time machine, borrowing elements from the shooter genre throughout its evolution over the years. Some of Overwatch's characters display the arena combat of Quake, while others capture the dynamism of the more modern Titanfall. Overwatch's cast also includes a more archetypical military-shooter character, Soldier 76. He serves as a gateway for players more accustomed to Call of Duty or Battlefield, ushering them into a more nuanced and versatile overall experience. These heroes may be the bricks comprising Overwatch's structure, but the map design is the mortar in between. Skirmishes play out across 12 locales in a futuristic version of Earth, from the foundries of industrial Russia to the shrines of rural Japan. These arenas mix high walkways and low pits, narrow sightlines with wide avenues. Battles change constantly, choke points become virtual morgues, and learning to use your character's range, damage, and special abilities is contingent on what the environments dictate. Variety in map design is one thing--precision in their layout is another entirely. And Overwatch is precision incarnate. What's impressive isn't Overwatch's ambition--its attempt to bring all these different factors together under one roof. What's impressive is that it fits these characters and interactions into an organic being, with ever-changing scenarios that keep Overwatch fresh through each match. It helps that you can switch heroes mid-match according to the ebb and flow of each situation. There's an enticing balance between mastering one character and trying someone completely new, and watching new layers unravel. But even more vital is the ease with which Overwatch teaches you valuable lessons. Playing becomes a digging process, and as you discover new ways to use each character on each map, how better to serve your team, and how to counter your most dangerous opponents, Overwatch's deepest layers begin to emerge. Imagine defending the last waypoint in Japan as the attackers escort their explosive payload to within yards of victory. Your team is spread around the room, on the upper catwalks and out in the open, standing in the way and keeping the opponents at bay. As the explosive expert Junkrat, you're launching grenades into clumps of enemies. You're laying bear traps to cover the walkway at your rear. You're disrupting the position of shield characters with the blast from your remote mines. But you're also watching your teammate's back as she snipes with Widowmaker. You're calling out enemy positions to Pharah as she glides above the fray with her rocket launcher ablaze. You're coordinating with Zarya, waiting until both of your ultimate abilities are ready. And as she launches her Graviton Surge into the room, sucking every enemy into one concentrated mass, you release your RIP-Tire explosive, steering it into the group and killing them all, buying your tank characters precious seconds to reverse the payload as the timer reaches zero and you win the match with bated breath. This is what Overwatch does to your brain. These are the thoughts that race through your head. These are the scenarios that encourage you to play the game in such ways. There's even a post-match voting period in which you congratulate individual efforts, whether it be the amount of hit-points Mercy healed, the number of warp portals Symmetra erected, or the percentage of damage Reinhardt blocked with his shield. In these moments, Overwatch is telling you one important thing: there is no single way to play. Unfortunately, it sometimes ignores this mantra. The end of each match initiates a ""Play of the Game"" highlight, which showcases the most impressive moment from the perspective of the player who performed it. However, unlike the post-match voting period, the highlight video almost always focuses on killstreaks. These are flashy--especially when the player shows a clear mastery of Reaper's close-quarters attacks, or Genji's ninja-star barrages--but they don't recognize healers or tank characters enough. It's a minor complaint, and only stands out because the rest of Overwatch is so accommodating to individual playstyles--but it's jarring nonetheless. It's also disappointing how, for every way Overwatch rewards mastery of your favorite characters, it stumbles with its randomized loot system. These awards are all aesthetic, to be clear--a new character skin here, a new celebration stance there--but too often loot crates contain unwanted items. More importantly, they delay the process of outfitting your favorite characters, the ones you use most often, the ones you grow attached to. You can accrue Overwatch gold to unlock specific items, but like the items themselves, gold is strewn throughout random loot crates. In this respect, Overwatch uses gambling to undermine your desire for specific unlocks. There is a genuine learning process here. There is real value to the time you spend understanding these overlapping systems. But in almost every other way, Overwatch encourages a more tangible sort of progression: that of filling a critical role on your team and understanding its intricacies the more you play, adapt, and grow. There is a genuine learning process here. There is real value to the time you spend understanding these overlapping systems. It's that intoxicating path of discovery that makes Overwatch so varied, so rewarding, and ultimately another seminal release from developer Blizzard. Overwatch is an intelligent cascade of disparate ideas, supporting one another, pouring into one another, and coiling around themselves as they flow into the brilliant shooter underneath.","Overwatch is a highly stylized team-based shooter set on earth in the near future. Every match is an intense multiplayer showdown pitting a diverse cast of soldiers, mercenaries, scientists, adventurers, and oddities against each other in an epic, globe-spanning conflict.",7.7
27,Peter Brown,Mature,,Fallout 4,"Nov 9, 2015"," After dozens of hours in the rough-and-tumble Commonwealth, the coast of Maine sounds like the perfect place for a sojourn in Fallout 4. Enjoy a boat ride; meet new people; solve a mystery with your best synthetic friend--what's not to love? Who am I kidding: Far Harbor is just as overrun with radiation, desperate factions, and mutated creatures as Fallout 4's main stage. Along its rocky shores and in its foggy woods lie odd characters and rewarding side quests, along with a bounty of new gear to acquire. Visiting Far Harbor is an excellent way to extend your enjoyment of Fallout 4's brand of combat and casual role-playing, but it doesn't succeed in all of its attempts to build on the foundation of the base game's story. In many ways, Far Harbor seems like a trip down memory lane. You once again set out in search of a missing child, and ultimately discover a society in the throes of a complicated conflict. The crazed Children of Atom worship radiation, taking refuge in the dense irradiated fog that covers the island. They are at odds with the citizens of Far Harbor: the seafaring town reduced to the only swath of land not overrun by fog. Elsewhere, synths who want to live in peace and isolation watch from the sidelines, though as you soon discover, a murky past brings their motivations into question. Shortly after you arrive on the island and help defend townsfolk from invading monsters, you're whisked away to the synth refuge in Acadia. Not long after, you're guided to The Children of Atom's sanctuary, called The Nucleus. Unless you deviate into side quests right away, you'll have met most of Far Harbor's big players in less than an hour, and these meetings deliver a rapid-fire procession of seemingly major events and revelations. Unfortunately, this eagerness backfires. Far Harbour isn't shy about asking you to join a murderous group of religious extremists, or attempting to make you question your own identity. While these moments have potential, they aren't given the time and space they need to spur a meaningful response. The biggest twist of all is so mired in logical inconsistencies that it practically feels like a joke. After the dozens of hours it took to form a position on the various players and problems in the main campaign, the abrupt propositions in Far Harbor feel cheap, to say nothing of how familiar the narrative's themes are at this stage in the game. The biggest risk Far Harbor takes is a trip into the memory banks of a synth, where you use Fallout 4's settlement-building toolset to recompile broken pieces of data. With a limited number of items at your disposal, you have to redirect lasers to break down barriers and place armaments of your own to defend the flow of information from cannon-toting viruses, all while trying your best not to walk into pitfalls. These sequences are visually distinct and put your abilities as a craftsman to practical use, but they come off as a half-baked puzzle game concocted to drum up variety. Up to the last puzzle, the solutions are easy to identify and execute. The final test, on the other hand, is sprawling and requires tedious exploration, made worse by the limited amount of resources you have to build bridges to and from the maps' various islands of data. As I dug my heels in and meticulously worked for a solution to the final puzzle, I yearned for adventure. For all the baggage in Far Harbor, it successfully upholds Fallout's tradition of combat, driven by odd requests from locals or by your own lust for loot. New weapons like the harpoon gun empower you to take on new creatures that are fast, resilient, and challenging enough to test seasoned survivors. The only hiccup that gets in the way comes from the fog that permeates Far Harbor, at least on PlayStation 4 and PC at launch--these versions suffer from optimization issues, with the PS4 version suffering the worst during fog-laced combat. The fog and the light that sneaks through it creates a great visual effect, but it's a shame that it comes at the cost of performance. For its new locations and weapons, the turbulent waters of Maine are a satisfying compliment to Fallout 4. But where Far Harbor succeeds in delivering more of the same great gameplay and oddball characters that made the main campaign such a joy, it can't muster an interesting story. It over-confidently asserts twists and conundrums, without doing enough to earn your investment in the outcome of your decisions. If a moving story is what you're after, steer your ship back to the shores of the Commonwealth.    ","As the sole survivor of Vault 111, you enter a world destroyed by nuclear war. Every second is a fight for survival, and every choice is yours. Only you can rebuild and determine the fate of the Wasteland. Welcome home.",8.2
28,Peter Brown,Everyone,8,Kirby: Planet Robobot,"Jun 10, 2016"," With plenty of wonderful games tied to his name, I'll never understand why Kirby isn't paraded around as prominently as Nintendo's other mascots. Kirby: Planet Robobot is the perfect example: it's another great Kirby side-scrolling platformer, and yet it's been largely flown under the radar since it was announced. Like so many of his past outings, Kirby's latest adventure is about partaking in a lively world filled with charming monsters. Kirby can inhale these creatures to acquire new abilities; you can go from swinging a sword to throwing bombs to riding a wave of poison all in the span of a few screens. Kirby has more than 20 transformations in Planet Robobot, and it's an impressive feat that each one offers a distinct skillset that redefines how you move, attack, and defend. Kirby's natural ability to flutter into the sky, swallow enemies and take on their powers make him a force to be reckoned with--even more so when he hops into Planet Robobot's mechs. When Kirby suits up, he trades agility for strength, earning the ability to punch through substantial objects and knockout enemies in a single blow. These heavy suits appear in the middle of levels and feel like a direct translation of the Ride Armor suits from Mega Man X games. I say ""suits"" because like our little pink friend, Kirby's mech can acquire extra abilities from enemies: he can blast enemies with sound waves as a massive boombox, wield two massive swords, or make use of a massive propellor that lifts his mech into the air while slicing through unsuspecting enemies. With access to so many tools, you can get through most levels without much trouble. However: unlocking the final stage in each of Planet Robobot's six worlds requires you to collect a certain number of code cubes, three of which are hidden in each stage. Though some code cubes are easy to stumble upon, you will have to go out of your way to access--let alone locate--most of the cubes in each stage. This is when Kirby's powers prove uniquely useful, as some cubes are only attainable if you're packing the appropriate abilities. The hunt for code cubes is made less tedious than it sounds by wild variations in level design that affect how your environment looks and how you navigate its challenges. You spend most of your time running and jumping about, moving not just to the left and to the right, but into and out of the background as well. Kirby also takes on side-scrolling shooting missions, which play similarly to arcade classics like R-Type or Gradius. With Kirby's inherent design that encourages you to play in different ways, these segments aren't a saving grace--they're the icing on the cake. This sentiment extends to the extra modes in Planet Robobot, which range from short diversions to generous unlocks, such as Meta Knight Returns. This mode in particular is enticing as it allows you to replay the entire game as Meta Knight, Kirby's long-time frenemy. This marks the third chapter in the Meta Knightmare saga, which began on Game Boy Advance with Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land. Though you are essentially replaying Planet Robobot's levels over again in this mode, Meta Knight plays drastically different than Kirby: he can't take on new powers, and instead relies upon his speed and trusty sword to surpass obstacles and enemies. Where the base game is about finishing levels and collecting code cubes while relishing in a wealth of powers, Meta Knight Returns is a time trial mode. The race against time and the added challenge of more difficult bosses is enough to warrant a second playthrough without fear of succumbing to deja vu. The other standout extra mode is unlocked from the start: Kirby 3D Rumble. This is a top-down, fully 3D Kirby game where your goal is to destroy every enemy on a map using as few moves as possible, achievable by inhaling multiple enemies at once. Like Captain Toad's levels in Super Mario 3D World, these stages feel like part of something bigger that could very well constitute its own game. I only wish there were more of them here: there are just over a dozen stages total. At least when you're done with them, you can look to Team Kirby Clash, which allows you to team up with AI or nearby friends to tackle bosses in a medieval fantasy-themed setting. Planet Robobot is a game about variety, not only in Kirby's innate copy ability, but also in its wealth of extra modes. Planet Robobot's meager difficulty may feel like a turn off at times, but it's not a reason to write it off. Once you spend time sampling the large selection of powers in each stage, taking in the detailed visuals, the catchy soundtrack, and exploring the wealth of extra modes on hand, you are so focused on the game's pervasive charm that you're looking forward to the next delightful surprise, rather than praying for a grueling test of skill. Planet Robobot is another great feather in Kirby's cap that shouldn't be overlooked.",,8.6
29,Justin Clark,Teen,4,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan,"May 24, 2016"," Without a doubt, Mutants In Manhattan is a disappointment, one multiplied several times over not just by its pedigree, but by the fact that the ingredients for a good game are present. Bringing the Turtles to life using the same attractive, cel-shaded style as the simple-but-satisfying Transformers: Devastation is the right choice. Sticking to the beat-em-up genre that has served the Turtles so well since 1989 is another right choice. The game also manages to get the tone right, with cutscenes delivering enjoyable slices of the Turtles as wise-cracking cartoon crimefighters, trying to figure out Shredder and Krang’s latest evil plan while simultaneously feeding their pizza addiction. And yet the second the controller is in your hands, all the surface details the game gets right begin to fall away. The tutorial and first stage introduce a plethora of new game mechanics. Green spheres can be collected to gain items and bonuses. The parry system, depending on when your turtle dodges, can have three different effects on an enemy. There is a Takedown mechanic, where unaware enemies can be destroyed in one hit if they don't see you coming first. Special Ninjutsu attacks can be swapped around in the menus, and unlocked using XP used during battle. Items and stat boosts can also be purchased from Splinter in the Turtles’ Lair whenever you find an open manhole. All of this creates the illusion of an action-RPG with depth. But it's a farce; there are very few battles in this game that cannot be solved by spamming basic light and heavy attacks. The rest, on the other hand, are needless distractions. Items are all over the place, but only the pizzas, which restore health, are of any service in a major fight. Ranged weapons don’t chip away nearly as much health as they should, and are awkward to pull out in battle. Power boosts offer a similarly minimal effect. Still, one imagines if the superfluous items were grafted onto a game whose core combat worked, it would be less of an anchor around the game’s neck. And unfortunately, the crux of the matter is that combat is a disaster. The core is certainly easy enough to understand, with two attacks, a jump, and a dodge, but hits have no heft, and even the simplest enemies in the first level take an inordinately long time to kill. Ninjutsu attacks, for all their flash and flair, don't always knock an enemy down, only knocking off a small portion of their health bar. The biggest detriment to combat is the sheer inability to tell what exactly is happening in any of it. If all of the above happened with just one Turtle onscreen, that’d be lackluster and frustrating, but still fundamentally understandable. But Mutants In Manhattan is a perpetual four-player experience, with three immeasurably broken A.I. Turtles picking up the slack when you haven’t roped friends into the fray. Four turtles fighting in the same area at the same time turns the battlefield into a sparkly cartoon dustcloud of mayhem. If there’s a moment the game actually starts to come together, it’s during boss fights. With only one giant enemy to focus on--whose attacks are flashy and brutal, but easy to read--the relative chaos of these encounters can at least make sense. Action takes on an arcade-y quality that momentarily conjures memories of great Turtles games from the past. There are also secret bosses who can show up when replaying a level that make a sincere plea for replay value, just to see what twists the game might throw your way the second time around. However, despite its relatively short playtime, Mutants In Manhattan isn’t a boss rush sort of game. There’s lots of running around samey-looking sewers, running across poorly designed rooftops, and performing random, disjointed, and boring fetch quests for a woefully underutilized April O’Neill before it’s time for the big fight. And once again the key problem rears its head. Fights are just wild button-mashers where the fruits of your labors leave the player apathetic, rather than looking forward to what Michelangelo could do to the to the next guy, or what Donatello might pull off this time. For the first time since the infamous dam level in the original NES Turtles game, God, it sucks being a turtle.",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan is a third-person action game featuring New York City's crime-fighting Heroes in a Half-Shell.,6.9
30,Kevin VanOrd,Mature,8,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"May 18, 2015"," “You can smell the delicate flowers,” says the duchess to Geralt of Rivia, and in that moment, you might believe that you can smell them, too. Like the full game, The Witcher 3’s final expansion, Blood and Wine, has a way of expressing its sensory delights so fully and richly that you could be convinced you really do feel the rain pouring on your face or the pesky tickle of a mosquito buzzing near your ear. That The Witcher 3 continues to look and sound so lavish is unsurprising, yet Blood and Wine’s visuals are even bolder and more vivid than the main game’s. At times, the vast new region of Toussaint seems to have been poured onto the screen from the pages of a fairy tale--and depending on your choices, you may literally find yourself drawn into one such tale. Blood and Wine is sometimes as thematically dark as its predecessors. The vampire-focused main story explores the creatures’ innate lust for blood, among other quirks and passions, and the related scenes are dramatic and distressing in fine Witcher tradition. Yet compared to the rest of The Witcher 3, Blood and Wine is brighter and more ebullient, downplaying the melancholy and bringing humor to the forefront. That isn’t to say that this series has never been funny; in fact, it’s always possessed a wicked sense of wit. The humor has never been this ubiquitous or straightforward, however. You might hear a local singing “El Condor Pasa” under his breath as you pass by on your search for a statue’s missing testicles, or you may do a double-take when you notice not-so-subtle references to GOG.com, publisher CD Projekt’s digital storefront. The self-referential humor reaches a head during a side quest involving hallucinogenic mushrooms, though it’s best that I don’t reveal the specifics. Suffice it to say that developer CD Projekt RED has no qualms about making fun of its own foibles. I can’t say the references always work in Blood and Wine’s favor, though. All too often, the fantasy I wanted to be living reminded me of the world I actually inhabit. Perhaps if Blood and Wine’s main story and characters were more engaging, the references wouldn’t have been so distracting, but none of Geralt’s new cohorts can match Yennefer’s lusty spark or The Bloody Baron’s brutal sorrow. Dwarfs in this universe have often been bankers--but in Blood and Wine, that’s almost the only role they play. It’s sensible, then, that the game’s most boring quest envelops you in a morass of financial red tape at the hands of a dwarven-run bank. And it isn’t made less boring by the quest’s knowing references to its own tedium. Don’t get me wrong: it’s easy to pick apart these details only because The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is such a stunning game that anything less than phenomenal is bound to stand out for being “merely” great. I missed the diversity of the old cast--Toussaint is inhabited mainly by normal humans--but I still got swept up in the populace’s squabbles and stresses. Family drama is often at the forefront (one of blood’s several meanings in Blood and Wine), whether that family be a set of violence-minded brothers, estranged sisters, or a married couple that continues its petty bickering even in death. The finest quests, however, are those that begin with odd mysteries and tell the bleakest tales. What should you make of a creature that collects thousands of spoons, and what is the best way to confront the curse that afflicts it? How is it that a tree can bleed, and what role does a local witch play in the matter? The combat scenarios rising out of these quests are similarly involving. Blood and Wine sets a challenging tone straight away by pitting you and a group of friendly knights against a charging colossus, and even if you enter the expansion at the suggested level of 35, you might find the battle more taxing than expected. Toussaint hosts a parade of grotesquely beautiful creatures prepared to defend themselves at any cost. Some of these sequences grow repetitive--how many predictable battles against those pus-spewing plants did the game really need?--but most are fun not only in their own right, but doubly so because of how they’re intertwined with the adventure surrounding them. In one quest, for instance, you accompany a photographer of sorts on an expedition to catalog the local wildlife. It’s a terrific mix of scouting with your Witcher senses, protecting your buddy from burrowing centipedes, and engaging in Blood and Wine’s delightful small talk, all of it capped by an adorable and memorable sequence involving peacocks. Blood and Wine’s new mutations system is there to ease at least some of the challenge. It delivers an additional array of passive bonuses, and also unlocks new skill slots. (And thank The Fire for that.) You can skip the side quest that reveals this system, but I wouldn’t recommend it, lest you end up wasting skill points on abilities you don’t care to use and have no slots for. The addition does have a bit of a balancing issue, however. Blood and Wine goes from a nicely challenging adventure to somewhat of a cakewalk when you enable the skill that adds a freezing effect to the Aard sign. Pushing away a horde of bandits with a fling of the wrist is even more delightful when some of them freeze and shatter on the spot, I admit, but the final battles lose a bit of their sting when you have such power at your fingertips. (I cannot deny the cleverness of those battles, however, from both a mechanical and a visual perspective.) The other notable addition is Geralt’s estate and vineyard, which you can upgrade by spending a bit of coin for a new bed, weapons racks, and other sundries. The vineyard is a minor element, all things considered, but it offers yet another chance to admire Blood and Wine’s extraordinary attention to detail. You get to name the wine your vineyard produces, and then nab and quaff bottles of it once it’s in production. Depending on your earlier choices, you might bring on an unexpected staff member to arrange meals, giving an otherwise unrelated quest additional emotional heft. The vineyard is also thematically appropriate, in two distinct ways. Firstly, Toussaint is wine country, so it’s sensible enough that Geralt would be based at such an estate. More importantly, however, the vineyard is a commemoration of Geralt’s adventures, as is Blood and Wine in its entirety. An artist paints Geralt’s portrait; you fight in a tournament, possibly under a crest that represents an almost-forgotten past; you celebrate your accomplishments with your major-domo with a glass of your own wine. These are all acts of tribute, a send-off to a hero. And make no mistake: Blood and Wine sees Geralt as a hero, not just as a monster-hunter for hire, no matter how much you haggle over your fees. The vineyard is a symbol of the retiring hunter, who leaves behind not just a mass of griffon entrails, but a legend referenced throughout Toussaint’s entire culture. Geralt deserves to be called a legend, of course, not least because he stars in one of the greatest role-playing games ever made. Perhaps we will join him in yet another adventure, but if Blood and Wine is the White Wolf’s final interactive appearance, he at least departs in style. I’ll miss you, Geralt--your impossibly perfect hair, your mercenary disposition, your stoic approach to horrific crimes and unspeakable tragedies. If you and Roach must ride into the sunset, then I’m glad the time we spent together was so enthralling.","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a story-driven, next-generation open world role-playing game, set in a visually stunning fantasy universe, full of meaningful choices and impactful consequences.

31,Janine Hawkins,Rating Pending,8,Duelyst,"Aug 23, 2016"," At the moment, anyone looking for a competitive card-based strategy game on PC is spoiled with options. Although Blizzard obviously didn't invent the genre, Hearthstone's runaway success has inspired other games aiming to tap into that player base and become just as successful. Duelyst might seem like just one more game on that ever growing list, but in spite of its similarities, it successfully distinguishes itself from the competition by adding a few new twists to the format. A lot of the trappings around Duelyst will make longtime Hearthstone players feel perfectly at home. You can select from several factions--equivalent to classes--and enter practice matches against AI, online matches with other players, or a tournament mode where decks are built on-the-fly. Three losses in a single tournament (a mode which is still in development and is therefore not always available) equals elimination, while the number of victories dictates the value of the reward a player receives. There are orbs instead of card packs to purchase with in-game or real currency, but they function in much the same way. Once opened, they spit out cards of varying rarity for the game's different factions, as well as a neutral faction that you can freely utilize. Unwanted cards can be broken down, coveted cards crafted, and decks can be customized to your heart's content. It all sounds so very familiar, but a match in Duelyst doesn't actually bear many similarities with Blizzard's blockbuster card game. Rather than playing cards as static objects on a 2D board, Duelyst's battles are set on a grid with opposing generals starting out on either side. Cards are then played to summon minions, but instead of being static actors on the board these minions (along with your general) can be moved around a set number of spaces in order to close-in on and attack the enemy. Ranged fighters and certain spells or abilities can accomplish that from a safe distance, but for the mostpart both minions and generals will need to get right up in a foe’s face to deal their damage. There's much more to Duelyst than playing the right cards at the right time, or building the perfect deck. Positioning can be just as important as any other element of play, and for every deck built around a highly mobile play style there's another built around denial of movement and rigid board control. The way minions can move and attack vary depending on the type of minion and the faction they belong to. Many Abyssian minions are low cost and low damage summons for example, but Abyssian spells are great for beefing them up to quickly overwhelm an opponent. Meanwhile, The Vetruvian faction favors flying minions who move unimpeded across the board. A Vetruvian player could build up their forces in an isolated corner out of harm’s way, then descend on the opposing general in a single turn. It’s a system that can feel a little intimidating if you’re not used to worrying about physical space when you lay your cards down, but the various faction specializations make it quite fun to experiment. It’s also worthwhile to experiment with the character at the helm of your deck. There are multiple generals in each faction that a player can choose from, each with their own distinct abilities that play to their faction’s strengths. Generals can also be enhanced by playing artifact cards which give them weapons and abilities. The right general combined with the right artifacts can be absolutely devastating, but three hits and they’ll be disarmed. The card system could potentially feel restrictive to someone coming to Duelyst from a strategy background, while a card gamer might find the board-based aspect an unnecessary complication. For those new to both, it may just feel overwhelming. There are a lot of very clever moves to be made when a solidly built deck, a lucky draw, and thoughtful board placement all converge, and thankfully Duelyst has a built-in way to show some of them off in the form of solo challenges. Solo challenges are presented like a puzzle, where you enter what appears to be a match-in-progress and are charged to end it in one turn by using a specific ability or trait. As an introduction to advanced techniques, these challenges are incredibly helpful because they provide practical examples and let you learn through experience, rather than by following explicit, dry tutorials. Unfortunately, practice mode is far less fruitful. The AI in practice matches is almost always predictable and easy to defeat. If I'm looking to develop and test strategies against a particular faction and their preferred techniques, playing against AI which hardly ever employs faction-specific capabilities isn't going to do me much good. Even if I want a more general form of practice, playing against AI that wastes turns on meaningless moves is not going to provide meaningful training. Solo Challenges make up for this in a way, but hoping for the perfect storm of cards in your hand and placement on the board so you can execute on that super hot trick you just learned isn't the most reliable strategy in an actual match. Visually, this game captures a bright and wonderful retro aesthetic, but as much as I could appreciate its style, I still found myself pining for the glossy, gilded illustrations and animations found in similar games. Duelyst's art is absolutely well done, but it fails to leave a lasting impression. Duelyst overlaps enough with similar games in the genre that stepping into it doesn't feel like starting from scratch, but it still manages to distinguish itself with some clever additions. While it still has its faults, those faults never overpowered the satisfying feeling of executing a perfect play.

32,Kevin VanOrd,Teen,8,Odin Sphere Leifthrasir,"Jun 7, 2016"," Fairy tales are rarely complex, but from their simplicity grows profound truths that resonate with both young and old. Odin Sphere Leithrasir tells five such tales, all intertwined into an overarching volume, each story glowing with heartwarming sincerity and clarity. Like in fables of yore, you can always tell who the bad guy is going to be, and love arrives with the chirps of bluebirds and the calls of trumpets. You could accuse Odin Sphere of too much telling and not enough showing, but its genuineness slips right past such criticism. You can’t stay cross with it any more than you can stay cross with a bright-eyed puppy playing in dandelions. It’s too earnest, too kindhearted, too sweet for that. Well, I suppose you might get a little cross. One of the five playable characters, the fairy called Mercedes, makes an insufferable squeak when performing actions like reloading her bow, and the recurring “blathering ingenue is forced to prove her worth” theme repeats often enough to get maudlin. But like any softy, I am as swept up by the fantasy as I was when Odin Sphere was first released in 2007. The first chapter, starring the Valkyrie Gwendolyn, sets a whimsical tone for the game to follow, and its tale of improbable love and family tragedy is still my favorite of the lot. Developer Vanillaware’s trademark painted visuals do much of the work in this regard. You can’t help but gawk at the starry sky from Gwendolyn’s balcony, or at Gwendolyn herself, whose three-tiered dress in certain story scenes is the very essence of Disney fairy-tales. Or consider her father Odin, whose cape flutters wondrously behind him on winds of unknown origin. (Or perhaps on the winds of his own farts. Who’s to say?) Such is the power of a colorful tale that only in retrospect do I wonder if Gwendolyn wasn’t suffering from some form of Stockholm Syndrome, given the nature of the romance she gets involved in. Regardless, it’s the kind of romance you see in musical theater or in opera, where all it takes is the space of a song and a few coy gestures for you to be believe a couple has fallen in love. And so it goes from beginning to end, introducing you to, among others, a prince turned into a bunnylike Pooka; a troubled survivor trying to prevent the very end of the world; and the queen of the netherworld, whose spitefulness makes that of Sleeping Beauty’s Maleficent pale in comparison. The five main chapters, as well as the ones you might unlock if you’re industrious enough, wind in and out of each other, lending new perspective to previous plot points. This entails a certain amount of repetition--you see the same characters from new angles, while traversing the same areas and encountering the same enemies. Yet Odin Sphere Leifthrasir is largely successful at fending off monotony, engaging you with its action-packed combat, and by keeping battles short and sweet, much like Gwendolyn herself. Whether you’re armed with Oswald’s sword or Mercedes’ bow, murdering ice trolls and salamanders always feels fluid and natural. Structurally, Odin Sphere is a role-playing game: you level up as you play, and spend skill points on new magical abilities, and upgrades to abilities you have already unlocked. Moment to moment, Odin Sphere is a 2D beat-em-up in which you string together slashes, aerial juggles, slide-kicks, and so forth until the screen is awash with wind and flame. Every character is responsive to your button-presses and stick-nudges. Whether you’re armed with Oswald’s sword or Mercedes’ bow, murdering ice trolls and salamanders always feels fluid and natural. It certainly helps that the frame rate holds up beautifully, whereas the original performed disastrously. You can further mix up the combat rhythm by tossing a single-use spell flask into the mix, thus summoning a volcano onto the battlefield, or enveloping the area in a toxic cloud. Enemies sometimes drop such flasks upon defeat, but you can also make them yourself using Odin Sphere Leifthrasir’s alchemy system, which benefits from a nice interface upgrade over the original. Things can still get a bit fiddly: there’s no obvious upside to your limited inventory space, so you end up backtracking through levels to get to a storage chest, which muddles the pace. But Odin Sphere’s flashes of brilliance overshadow its bungles. The way health and leveling are handled is one such example. You can plant seeds almost anywhere and grow plants that yield various fruits, or even sheep. (Yes, sheep, which yield tasty lamb chops.) You can also visit a restaurant and order some victuals, or call on the traveling chef, who unfolds his table with unparalleled stylishness. Wherever your treats come from, they not only restore your health, but they also grant experience points. It’s a terrific confluence of two systems that grants you both a short-term recovery benefit (healing) and a long-term recovery benefit (gaining levels and growing more powerful). It also minimizes grind, since you needn’t engage in unnecessary battles to level up. The downside: eating when your health is full can sometimes feel like you’re wasting the benefit, but you are rarely short on edibles, so the sense of waste is more of an emotional response than a practical concern. You see the same sights and converse with the same people again and again, but the brevity of battle and the incessant supply of rewards and accompanying triumphant music keep the atmosphere lively. Level design is another example of Odin Sphere’s cleverness. Though each side-scrolling level is functionally flat, it’s actually a circle, so you always end up back where you started if you run in a single direction. It’s not a novel concept--Defender was doing this back in 1981--but this device makes Odin Sphere easy to navigate, and its minimaps easy to understand. Furthermore, levels are small, and standard enemy encounters usually last under 45 seconds. You’re rewarded with a score and a reward for your prowess--a delightful showering of coins, and perhaps a new recipe, a flask, or an equippable accessory. You see the same sights and converse with the same people again and again, but the brevity of battle and the incessant supply of rewards and accompanying triumphant music keep the atmosphere lively. Note that the combat system is not as it was in the original, though a slightly enhanced version of the original is included in this package, if you prefer it. On the whole, Leifthrasir is smoother and quicker than the original, not only due to new moves and attacks, but also due to a change to the power meter. No longer does power decrease with standard attacks, except in Mercedes’ case, and no longer can you damage yourself with your own spells. These are fundamental changes that makes boss fights easier than before, and allow you to play more offensively. I like the new system, frankly, but I also found myself wishing I could enjoy the new presentation--new scenes, new visuals, greater field of view--while using the original combat. If you want to see the new content and presentation but prefer the old battle system, you’re out of luck. That’s a disappointing turn of events if you’re one to resist change, but I prefer the new combat, all in all. It’s snappy, it’s got momentum, and it keeps me in the thick of the action, whether I’m fighting off fairies and frogs, or whether a gargantuan dragon is charging at me. He’s a lovely dragon, too, with a throaty baritone delivery and a desire to help you out, even if you just spent the last few minutes slashing at his scales and setting him on fire. He’s one of Odin Sphere Leifthrasir’s many joys, though he’s not the game’s sole defining element. There is Cornelius’s dramatic pose as he receives rewards; there is the dwarven skyship, and all the Steampunk sensibilities it entails. If I had to choose just one detail as a favorite, however, it comes back to Maury, the traveling chef, and the enthusiasm and flair with which he unpacks his supplies. He brings to his world the same amount of cheer that Odin Sphere Leifthrasir brings to me--and who couldn’t use a little more cheer?","Odin Sphere Leifthrasir is a HD remake of Vanillaware's PlayStation 2 game, Odin Sphere.",9.1
33,Scott Butterworth,Teen,7,Mirror's Edge Catalyst,"Jun 7, 2016"," There are moments when all of Mirror's Edge Catalyst's components fall into place, moments when intricate level design allows the fluid freerunning to shine, the mission at hand delivers a memorable set piece, or the open world surprises with a cleverly hidden area. Between those moments, there's a disappointing amount of filler and several mechanics--most notably the combat--that trip up the experience, but these stumbling blocks aren't enough to erase the magic of those instances where everything goes right. Much of that magic stems from the game's signature mechanic: parkour. Unlike most first-person action games, Catalyst emphasizes precision platforming over guns and grit. Protagonist Faith Connor's moveset consists of vaults, rolls, wall-runs, and more, all of which demand some degree of skill from players. Split-second timing can determine the fluidity of an animation, and successfully chaining successive moves over great distances requires serious dexterity. Skill-based traversal is not only cool conceptually, it's satisfying in practice thanks to responsive controls, naturalistic animations, and the variety of movement options at your disposal. Even little touches like your controller vibrating right before impact after a long drop help make movement even more exhilarating than it was in the original game. Mastering your environment with flawless speed proves just as thrilling and liberating as executing a complex combo in a fighting game or nailing a demanding solo in a rhythm game. The flipside of this coin, however, is the clunky, cumbersome combat. Faith relies entirely on her feet and fists when taking down enemies, so the game encourages you to pair your attacks with her movement for maximum impact. When it works, it's awesome: wall-running into a flying kick or sliding into an enemy's knees and watching his helmet slam into the ground is super gratifying. Problem is, many environments are too open to foster this form of kinetic combat, and without boxes to vault over or raised platforms to dive from, you're left clumsily dodging around enemies on flat ground and slowly chipping away at their health instead. Worse still, some enemies are programmed to automatically counter certain attacks regardless of context, which feels awkwardly unrealistic. Because the enemy AI is bizarrely predictable, I generally just spammed whatever cheap move I found most effective against that specific enemy type. Thankfully, I could often avoid combat altogether; Catalyst even encourages this by making Faith essentially bulletproof if you fully fill her Focus meter by keeping her momentum high. In other words, you're much more likely to survive if you keep on moving instead of stopping to fight. More than once, however, I was locked in a relatively sparse arena and forced to defeat a preset number of enemies. Given the game's focus on movement over fighting, these moments, though rare, were totally unnecessary. The upgrade system is another low point for Catalyst. Some essential maneuvers that should simply be available from the start--like the quickturn and tactical roll--must be unlocked, and other abilities can't be upgraded until you've progressed far enough into the campaign. This practice of artificially gating upgrades feels forced and pointless, though thankfully, the progression system ultimately has little impact on the moment-to-moment gameplay since you'll already have all the essentials unlocked after the first hour or two. All later upgrades--such as increased health and damage--are helpful but by no means crucial. Other important aspects of Catalyst end up feeling a bit more mixed, though most ultimately add more than they detract. The open-world structure, for example, results in quite a bit of empty commuting as you run from mission to mission (at least until you unlock more safe houses for fast travel). The Runner Vision tool automatically guides you down the most expedient path to your next objective, which means you end up seeing certain routes over and over again. Outside of the campaign, however, the world becomes an enticing playground full of collectibles to uncover and races to run. The inherent joy of the core mechanics makes unstructured exploration feel worthwhile, in part because you can ignore Catalyst's weak combat system and focus entirely on what the game does best: running. If you turn off Runner Vision entirely and simply rely on subtle environmental cues like the telltale blackfoot prints you'll occasionally find running up walls, you'll suddenly start to notice vents, ledges, and even entire concealed areas you previously ran right past. Several of the side missions end up feeling just as substantial as the story missions, but even just figuring out how to scale a building for no reason can be rewarding in its own right. And unlike many of the story quests, most side missions genuinely challenge your abilities. I failed certain timed events repeatedly, but I steadily improved until I finally beat the clock. And when I did, I really felt like I'd earned the elation I experienced. You can also craft and share your own public, playable online time trial events by dropping markers in the environment, which further deepens the open-world experience. It's a simple yet ingenious system, and a serious boon to the game's longevity. This is not to say Catalyst's world is impeccable, though. Its early rooftops look a bit empty and sterile and fail to provide much gameplay variety. While the stark white rooftops are an understandable aesthetic choice given the game's dystopian premise, these environments still grow repetitive over time. Thankfully the world is large and diverse enough to compensate for these shortcomings eventually. Late in the game, you'll find an elaborate construction site packed with stellar level design and squalid tunnels that offer visual relief from the city's samey rooftops. As for the campaign, some missions feel routine and unimaginative, sending you on simple errands to areas you've already seen. But others deliver truly pulse-pounding tension or thoughtful environmental puzzle solving. You'll zipline from the tops of buildings, dive over security lasers, and escape from more than one collapsing construction site. While it's damn disappointing that later levels up the difficulty by adding more enemies rather than crafting more elaborate environments to test your parkour skills, the campaign still provides several welcome challenges and unforgettable moments. The story stringing all these missions together is unremarkable but also unobtrusive. It disappointingly squanders the intriguing near-future dystopian premise by focusing on a half-baked corporate conspiracy filled with predictable twists and paper-thin characters, but the dialogue cringe factor is low and the narrative lends a discernible arc to the action. As much as I hated some of the character design and felt let down by the lackluster world building, the story does exactly enough to move the game along without leaving a lasting impression, positive or negative. Finally, it's worth noting this final version of the game runs smoother than the somewhat sloppy beta. The frame rate dipped once or twice and I experienced a small handful of glitches like multiple audio cues playing simultaneously, but load times were completely reasonable and none of the technical hiccups I experienced actually impacted the gameplay. Catalyst may not be the best looking game out there, but it runs well enough to keep you invested in the action. And really, being able to focus on and enjoy the gameplay is what matters. Yes, certain portions of the game are deeply unimpressive, but I rarely (if ever) found them frustrating, painful, or unavoidable, which allowed me to overlook those elements and enjoy the unique pleasures Catalyst provides. I was consistently wowed by the movement and everything that comes with it, so while it's a disappointing action game, it works wonderfully as a platformer, puzzler, and racing game. And for that reason, I can't wait to keep playing.",Mirror's Edge is a first-person action-adventure game from DICE where players will discover the origin story of Faith and delve deeper into the inner workings of the city and the world around it.,7.1
34,Peter Brown,,8,Edge of Nowhere,"Jun 6, 2016"," When I sit down to play a game in VR, I never expect that I'll last for more than an hour at a time. Headsets aren't seamless, and the experience of being enveloped in a game can be physically taxing depending on how it utilizes the hardware. When I played Edge of Nowhere, I never felt compelled to quit or take a break. It strikes a natural balance, leveraging VR's inherent sense of immersion to evoke emotional reactions, while delivering its gameplay in a familiar and intuitive manner. This is a four-hour experience that you play in one sitting not because it's hypothetically better that way, but because it successfully commands your attention from beginning to end. Your troublesome journey takes place in Antarctica, where you're on a rescue operation in search of a missing scientific expedition. After your plane crash lands, killing your pilot and leaving you to fend for yourself, you have no choice but to trudge into the unknown, following the trail of gear left in the wake of the missing party. With this setup, it makes sense that Edge of Nowhere is linear; there's no time to waste in a harsh environment when lives are at stake. The crew you're searching for was led by your former mentor, Professor Edwards, who believed that Antarctica would not only contain evidence of ancient undocumented lifeforms, but that they were still there, thriving in the shadows. The backstory is told through intermittent hallucinations, potentially brought on by the head injury you sustained during the plane crash. During these moments, you witness memories of Edwards' failed pleas to the scientific community, and of Eva, your wife and fellow scientist, who daringly stood behind Edwards' unpopular theory. As you soon discover, they were onto something. Your search begins on top of the arctic ice sheet--you slide down snow-packed slopes, leap across fields of glaciers, and cross crumbling, rudimentary bridges. But you quickly find your way underground, into the den of the foretold ancient beasts. Little by little, you grow increasingly aware of monsters lurking on walls and ceilings, scuttling out of sight just before you can get a good look. In these moments, the benefits of VR are immediately apparent. Edge of Nowhere is a third-person experience, but being enveloped in a headset, cut off from the real world, makes the sense of being consumed by darkness and tight-spaces feel eerily convincing. If you're a fan of sci-fi horror films from the '80s, you'll pick up on details that recall James Cameron's Aliens--creatures unfurl from egg-sacks in rooms bound by mysterious, organic architecture. Similarly, the arctic setting and the few monsters that appear vaguely human will bring back memories of The Thing. When the horrific elements underground overlap with the protagonist's hallucinations, Edge of Nowhere can be a truly disturbing experience that's made authentic through its use of VR. Despite being overwhelmed by fear and doubt, you aren't helpless thanks to your shotgun and a reliable throwing arm. Edwards' ancient creatures rely on sonar and their sense of hearing to track prey. By throwing rocks that you find on the ground, you can trick them into chasing false targets, allowing you to sneak by undetected. Flee too fast, and expect to be tailed by every monster in the room. This occasionally turns into a riveting chase sequence, with monsters nipping at your heels as you bound across ice that shifts and breaks underfoot. Get caught, however, and the fastest monsters will murder you instantly. If running isn't an option, you can kill most enemies with a well-placed shotgun blast--you aim the reticle effortlessly using Rift's positional tracking--but you won't have enough ammo to do so consistently. When I can't pick up a cache of shotgun ammo lying in an abandoned camp because I'm already carrying four shells--hardly a lot by anyone's standards--I'm brought back to reality. Because you're only allowed to carry four shotgun shells for most of the game, practically every monster encounter is a stealth puzzle by default, where your shotgun--or your relatively weak ice pick--is a last resort. When I'm sliding off of cliffs and have to catch myself on a wall with rickety climbing gear, I buy into the thrill. When I'm descending into otherwordly environments, confronted by mangled corpses dangling from ceilings and massive, alien entities, I'm on edge. But when I can't pick up a cache of shotgun ammo lying in an abandoned camp because I'm already carrying four shells--hardly a lot by anyone's standards--I'm brought back to reality; I'm playing a video game that unreasonably limits my abilities in order to inflate tension. Realizing this, stealth quickly becomes the least enjoyable aspect of the game. Disappointing as this habit may be, Edge of Nowhere doesn't allow for lingering feelings. It keeps up a rapid pace, shifting between storytelling, stealth, and action set pieces. The process of going underground, surfacing, and reliving the past through troubling visions grows familiar, but you learn to appreciate each beat for what it offers. On top of the ice, you can take comfort in the blue skies and timid wildlife as you leap and bound, free from the threat of enemies. On the other hand, you begin to anticipate the weirdness that awaits you underground, which pulls you into intoxicating despair. Above all else, the air of uncertainty that plagues the antagonist's state of mind gets under your skin and keeps you hooked. The more you learn about the past, the more doubts you have about the present, resulting in an increasing number of haunting visions and unanswerable questions.  Edge of Nowhere is a model example of how to integrate traditional gameplay into VR. At the end of my journey, I was gripped by what I had seen, and thoroughly impressed by how it unraveled before me. Edge of Nowhere is a model example of how to integrate traditional gameplay into VR, striking a wonderful balance between showcasing the capabilities of Rift and delivering engaging action.

35,Jason D'Aprile,,8,Excubitor,"May 26, 2016"," Excubitor is one of the more clever takes on old-school, top-down shooting we’ve seen in some time. After a few minutes with the game, its mix of classic arcade-style gameplay with modern tower defense mechanics seems so logical, you’ll wonder why there haven’t been more attempts at this cross-genre combination. Across four planets and over a dozen levels, players must pilot their upgradeable Hammerhead ship to hold back waves of drones, protect their mothership, and build up defenses. Similar to games like Kingdom Rush or Defense Grid 2, the giant maps feature numerous spots for building a variety of towers. As in a standard tower-defense game, Excubitor gives you a moment at the beginning of each level to lay down your defenses and then (usually) a short period of rest between waves to build more towers, upgrade current towers, or dismantle unneeded structures. The difference between this and the average tower-defense game is you control your ship directly at all times. You can’t rely entirely on automated weapons, especially when the action heats up; there’s a frenetic pace to the game that frequently requires you to be in two or three places at once. This is especially important to remember when it comes to the Antares--your mothership. While the Hammerhead can be regenerated if it gets destroyed, once the Antares is destroyed, it’s game over. There are plenty of layers of strategy to manage in Excubitor, and they keep you on the edge of your seat. Building up defenses around the Antares is almost always the top priority since it can be quickly overwhelmed if you aren’t paying attention. Having to focus on defense creates a welcome and different feel compared to traditional 2D shooters, where you simply scroll forward while destroying everything you can. With nine distinct types of towers to build, there's ample room for experimentation to see what weapons work best for any given situation. These towers range from anti-air missiles and machine-gun batteries to EMP pulses that slow ships down, and even a powerful laser weapon that bounces from enemy to enemy. Building anything requires power, however, which can be problematic. You’ll start each level with a certain amount of construction energy, and you can earn more by building a generator. But you have to sacrifice space typically reserved for turrets to do so. Balancing your defense with the need for more power is a constant battle, lending Excubitor a spare, but effective bit of resource management. Maps also contain elements that can potentially help stem the tide of overwhelming enemy forces. Levels often feature environmental hazards and traps like huge fuel tanks that can be destroyed to create a circle of fiery death, mine-throwing plants to help beat a giant boss, and other interactive tools of destruction. It’s a nice addition to the game that allows for consistently satisfying destruction. But Hammerhead remains your best weapon through the game. This spunky little ship can be upgraded from top to bottom and supports a variety of weapons systems. There are 17 in all, many of which are unlocked over time. The ship has two weapons slots to outfit with disparate items Standard machine guns and rockets are effective standbys, while the shotgun-like weapon provides a satisfying sense of power at close range. The more sci-fi weapons, like the multi-targeting Tesla coil, feel ripped straight out of classic shooters like Raiden. Flame and ice throwers are a creative touch that let you simultaneously freeze and fry when both are equipped, which is terrific fun if only for short-range use. Your ship can be upgraded to be tougher, faster, and more offensively effective as well, and all weapons can be further enhanced with three or four tiers of upgradeable options. Levels are also packed full of goodies to find. Every destroyed drone and building provides the currency necessary to buy and upgrade new weapons between levels, and there are specific caches that can be activated for other bonuses. Many of these bonus stores require you to hold your position for a period of time, so there’s a trade-off between focusing on your primary objective and sticking it out for more collectables. Levels are designed to force players into risk/reward situations, where frequently crossing from one end of the map to the other is a necessity. Backtracking isn't tedious because there’s enough exploration and action in each level that it feels almost like a roller-coaster ride. Certain objectives might be in one corner of the map, while the Antares is on the opposite side and potential riches can be scattered anywhere in between--all while multiple waves of enemies are approaching. These planet excursions each end with a boss battle--nail-biting events that require the precise use of towers, environmental traps, and speed. Since you’re simultaneously trying to destroy a giant mechanized terror and keep the Antares alive, boss battles feel like wars of attrition. You’ll constantly be trying to whittle down the boss spacecraft’s defenses, wait for its weak spot to appear, and damage it. There’s also the added complexity of rushing around to rebuild destroyed defenses and, most importantly, keep the mobs of drones from overwhelming the Antares. Even on the normal difficulty setting, these boss levels are trying, frantic exercises, but beating them is immensely satisfying. Fast action and strategy define Excubitor, and the smartly-designed levels and customization options encourage experimentation with the different weapon load-outs. Excubitor is a great action game that deftly mixes two distinct genres into one great new flavor.","Excubitor is an action shooter at its core that challenges the player to strategically control the battlefield whilst using skill based mechanics. The player will have to master three key gameplay features: Offense, Defense and Resource Management. Each level contains strategic locations, allowing the player to build defenses, interact with the environment and change the enemies’ tactics.",0
36,Richard Wakeling,Teen,6,Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,"May 27, 2016"," Every Sherlock Holmes game is burdened with a question of “how?” How do you adapt the world’s greatest detective for the interactive medium of video games? How do you give players the power fantasy of embodying the man with all the answers, without diminishing a crucial sense of challenge? How do you test a player’s investigative skills, without it feeling like they’re just following Sherlock’s lead? These are all questions Ukrainian developer Frogwares is accustomed to answering, having developed nine Sherlock Holmes games over the past fifteen years. Its last entry, 2014’s Crimes & Punishments, answered these queries more astutely than most by placing the onus of responsibility squarely in the player’s hands. Sure, it may have been somewhat easy to uncover all of the clues with Sherlock’s full range of near supernatural powers at your disposal, but piecing each clue together, arriving at a plausible conclusion, and being confident that you were convicting the right suspect was an altogether different beast. With no wrong answers, it was less a game about rights and wrongs, and more about your interpretation, where Sherlock’s moral compass was your obligation, and you were forced to decide if these people should walk free, spend time behind bars, or worse. The latest entry in the series, Sherlock Holmes: The Devil’s Daughter, takes this unusual premise and applies it to five new Sherlockian tales of intrigue, suspense, and grey moral quandaries. As with Crimes & Punishments, this partition of cases is structurally sound. Without the need to stretch out one case over the length of an entire game, these bite-sized stories are free to move along at a fairly brisk pace, maintaining suspense throughout and hitting satisfying crescendos. There’s some foreshadowing sprinkled throughout that alludes to the titular Devil’s Daughter, but otherwise these are all disparate cases, branching a range of interesting subjects, from peculiar murders, to a deceptive traffic accident, and even an attempt on Sherlock’s life. If you’ve played Crimes & Punishments, locations like Scotland Yard and Sherlock’s flat on Baker Street will be instantly familiar, yet The Devil’s Daughter still resembles a soft reboot of sorts. This is partly due to the sprightly redesigns of both Sherlock and his trusty sidekick Dr. Watson--with Holmes transforming into a bit of a Jon Hamm-alike. Admittedly, this doesn’t change all that much: the writing and voice acting are still decent, with a few notable exceptions (such as the grating caricature of Sherlock’s daughter), and even Sherlock is a little less forthright--a little less of a decorous bore--which makes him slightly more enjoyable to be around. There’s actually a tinge of Robert Downey Jr.’s Sherlock about him, which seems like a conscientious decision when you consider the other ways in which The Devil’s Daughter has tweaked the formula. Devil's Daughter strikes me as a game attempting to push the series forward in a presumptive attempt to attract a more mainstream audience. It’s all a bit triple-A, if not in practice, then at least in spirit. Unfortunately it’s an approach that never really achieves anything but middling results. You can now venture out onto the streets of Victorian London for the first time in the series--passing merchants shilling their wares, or overhearing the downtrodden complaining about the economy--but it’s mostly inconsequential. You’ll occasionally have to find a house or two by following road signs, but you spend most of the game fast-travelling from one location to another (the long loading times will test your patience). While at first this adventure to the outside world seems novel--providing the game with a welcome sense of time and place--it soon becomes an afterthought as early as the second case, and feels like a missed opportunity. In fact, the most meaningful usage of London’s cobblestone streets arrives early in the first case, when you play as young Wiggins (Sherlock’s eyes-on-the-street) and are tasked with tailing a potential suspect through the winding back alleys of Whitechapel. If you’re rolling your eyes at the very thought of a tailing mission, you’re right to do so: this bout of stalking is as bad here as any Assassin’s Creed game. Though, mercifully, it only shows up this one time, which is a common theme throughout The Devil’s Daughter, as mechanics are forgotten just as quickly as they’re introduced. It’s quite the list, too. There’s a section where you have to run through a forest, managing stamina, and ducking behind cover to escape an impassioned gunman. Some rudimentary stealth makes an appearance, too, as you stand behind things and make note of guard patterns to sneak through a cemetery unnoticed. There’s one part where you switch between Sherlock and Watson to pull levers and push boxes in order to reach a higher platform, and a comical bar fight that is overcome with a most egregious process of trial and error. There’s even some Uncharted-style tomb raiding as you contend with spike pits and booby-trapped rooms during an illusionary jaunt through an ancient temple. The Devil’s Daughter is certainly varied, and I appreciated that I wasn’t doing the same exact things in every single case. The problem with this scattershot of action-oriented asides is that they’re mechanically unrefined and terribly overdrawn. Player movement is clunky at best, and the things you’re doing are rather dull and derivative, which is only exacerbated when they drag on for too long. The game is spread too thin, with a variety of activities that rarely coalesce into something enjoyable. Fortunately, solving cases is often a joy, and is done in a plethora of ways that delve into Sherlock’s idiosyncratic methods of investigation. The basic mechanics work as they have done previously--with a few minor tweaks here and there--and revolve around surveying crime scenes to gather evidence, interrogating suspects and witnesses alike, and using Sherlock’s divine powers of deduction to piece everything together. Collecting evidence is relatively straightforward for the most part, and the locations you visit are beautifully detailed. They’re varied, too--taking you from an opulent bowls club to an illegal gambling den perched on one of London’s ramshackle docks--and sleuthing your way through them is a real treat. Occasionally you need to utilize Sherlock’s Victorian Detective Vision to uncover clues ordinary folk wouldn't notice. And things can also get a little tricky when, say, there’s a lock that needs to be picked, or an ancient Mayan text that has to be translated. These more traditional puzzles are dotted throughout, and put the conundrum-solving part of your brain to good use. A few had bamboozled me on more than one occasion. And if they’re too intricate, or if you only really care about the story, they can always be skipped without penalty. I’ve always enjoyed the interrogation component of crime solving games, and The Devil’s Daughter puts a wonderfully felicitous spin on proceedings. At any time during conversations you can slow down time and zoom in on specific aspects of the person you’re talking to. This allows Sherlock to parse details that you or I may never notice. A sewn patch on a child’s clothing, for example, might look insignificant, but to Sherlock it’s an indication that his parents take good care of him; and that his skinny arms (a sign of malnourishment) aren’t born from negligence, but from a severe lack of income. This is important because, in a very Sherlockian way, you can often catch someone lying by contradicting their statement with a detail you picked up just by observing them. If you’re missing a particular piece of information, you’ll lose out on these opportunities, which injects a welcome dose of meaningful interactivity into what was previously a passive affair. Once you’ve spoken to enough people and gathered the requisite evidence, it’s time to piece everything together and come to a conclusion. This takes place within a literal representation of Sherlock’s mind, with clues depicted as neurons that can be linked together so long as they’re relevant to one another. Link enough clues and this invariably uncovers more clues, until you’re able to reach an outcome that’s consistent with your interpretation of events. And that’s key, remember. There will often be two or more suspects, each with evidence suggesting both their possible guilt and innocence. It’s up to you to paint a picture of the case and come to a decision that you’re happy with. It’s a peculiar way of ensuring Sherlock is always right--and maintains his air of superiority--but it works. If there’s any failing, it’s that this concept robs each case of the satisfaction of knowing you did a good job. Yet, more than any other game of its ilk, it made me think and contemplate my decisions in a way that had me scouring back through all the evidence, just to make sure I was absolutely confident in my answer. Less fantastic, however, are The Devil’s Daughter’s technical shortcomings. Visually, this is a handsome game, but the framerate has trouble keeping up, and screen tearing is a near-constant nuisance. Mechanically, it’s not particularly intensive, so these issues aren’t as heinous as they maybe could have been. But they are noticeable, and, combined with the excruciating loading times, amount to a game that’s not as optimized as one might hope. Ultimately, Sherlock Holmes: The Devil’s Daughter succeeds where its predecessor did, by presenting a generous spate of intriguing cases, and giving you the freedom to come to your own conclusions. It’s a fantastic detective game; it’s just a shame that it's bogged down by myriad technical issues, and a mediocre attempt to inject some action into proceedings.","Sherlock Holmes: The Devil’s Daughter, the eighth game in the series, is an incredible adventure game with unique gameplay blending investigation, action and exploration for an extraordinary experience that will test the limits of players' nerves and intelligence.",7
37,Daniel Starkey,Teen,7,Tropico 5,"May 23, 2014"," As the head of Tropico, you're the brilliant mastermind guiding a mass of bumbling idiots, and it is through your power and will alone that any of them manage to accomplish anything in Tropico 5. You set the budgets for every building and figure out where everything needs to go, like whether you'll keep food on the island for your people to eat, or if you direct it to a cannery and sell it to the highest bidder. Each of these choices come with consequences, though. Eventually, you have enough factions on your island that they'll start having their own ideas of how to run Tropico best. Their opinions are wrong, of course. Only you know best, but their concerns still have to be addressed lest you find yourself in the middle of an uprising. And those are troublesome things. All of these different factions, their leaders, and the choices you make that mold their opinion of you are vital pieces that reflect the game's central focus: keeping you in power. Whether you're kind of cruel doesn't matter, so long as you can maintain your position. And that fits with the game's cheeky sense of humor. Your advisor, Penultimo, is so foolish that he'll spout Batman jokes while you hunt down crime lords, or get distracted by jewelry when you first learn how to refine gold. It's a tone that seeps into the game at nearly every level from missions and diplomatic errands to curt quips when rebels get testy. Granted, all of these things come at a cost. If your people are starving it's hard to maintain a strong, healthy work force. Without that, you won't be making much money at all--either for Tropico or your offshore accounts. Corruption too, while advantageous for your dynasty, drives up the cost of buildings, making critical resources tougher to provide for your populace. It pays, then, to keep your people happy and healthy. It's easier to just give them decent housing than it is to suppress protestors, but sometimes things don't always go your way. Tropico 5 is about managing in and outflows of resources. And that's not always consistent or stable. Your sole connection to the world outside, at least at first, is your port. You have to trade for anything you can't make directly, and trade is the key to keeping your coffers filled. Food is your first priority. But once you've got your citizens fed, you can start cutting down your forests and refining the lumber into planks to sell. Or you can bypass that--try to find a gold mine and make jewelry instead, or grow sugar and distill it for rum. How you build out your economy is up to you. The opening is simple because you'll only have one supply chain to worry about at first. As your nation grows, new resources will become available, others will deplete, and trade routes will shift. Each of these forces acts like a test, of sorts. They check to see if your island's fledgling economy is strong enough to weather shocks. In time, Tropico will throw in even more complex forces. Different factions like the United States and USSR will pressure you to trade with them. They'll ask you to supply them with materials, and, in true, tongue-in-cheek Tropico fashion, you'll have to wrangle your incompetent staff from making a fool of you on the world's stage. It's telling that one of the most advanced technologies you can research is just ""Table Manners."" It's an effective chain of events that, while repetitive, keeps you on your toes. You can't settle into a set economic strategy because some external force or an idiot islander will always come up and nudge you off that course. In action, it all just works, and while Tropico tries to offload some of the micromanagement involved with transportation, for example, there's still plenty of layers of depth here for those that want to dig into the game. In a welcome surprise the console versions translate almost all of that depth. That's rare for a console port of a PC strategy game, a genre notorious for its dependence on a mouse and keyboard, but the transition isn't perfect. The biggest problem I had was when I was trying to track down a few crime bosses to have them assassinated. They were stirring up some trouble and while police force knew who they were, my coppers weren't doing much to put them behind bars. Since Tropico renders every one of your citizens so that you can follow them around, bribe them, or gather useful info about how your people live, I was able to track down one crime lord. I zoomed all the way in to highlight him and then I had him killed. As I soon found out, though, I nabbed the wrong person. I not only had a political incident on my hands, but I'd wasted some money and lost a valuable worker. I tried again and missed a second time. Finally, I got him on the third attempt, but the sequence was frustrating and showed that while Tropico's console port is pretty spot-on as strategy games on consoles go, it still has some minor problems. Though, viewed from another, more satirical lens, it's possible my fumbles were representative of the collateral damage powerful figures incur when they use dirty tactics to silence their opponents. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it. Tropico 5 on consoles is a great port. It's a faithful recreation of the PC classic and a welcome addition to the scant city builders console players can enjoy.",Tropico 5 has you take on the role of El Presidente as you control the infamous  island of Tropico during early colonial times and then guide it through the centuries as the world changes and moves ever forward.,7.6
38,Peter Brown,Everyone,4,Dangerous Golf,"Jun 3, 2016"," Demanding equal parts finesse and intuition, golf is a sport few will ever master. A poor swing here, a bad lie there, and even the most passionate golfer can see their enjoyable pastime turned into an exercise in anger management. Dangerous Golf, on the other hand, eschews precision in favor of chaos. Like a drunken afternoon at the driving range, hitting a golf ball in Dangerous Golf is about expressing power, and nothing like actual golf. Your priority is to smash into as many objects as possible in everyday environments like bathrooms, kitchens, and fancy estates. It's a diabolical fantasy brought to life, but it's not half as fun as it sounds. Across four countries and numerous locales, you will hurtle golf balls into objects including fine dining ware, pianos, priceless works of art, and--why not--urinals. Don't worry about choosing an appropriate club or timing your swing just right. Simply aim the camera, press a button, and let the catharsis of destruction sink in. When you break enough items in a level, you can execute a follow-up Smashbreaker shot, which allows you to manually steer a bouncy, flaming wrecking ball, plowing through props and racking-up score multipliers until your timer runs out. Wrapping your head around the physics of a bouncing golf ball is easier said than done, especially when the game's camera is obscured by flying pieces of broken objects. Once your Smashbreaker shot is powered up, you have to use both the left stick and the camera to control the ball, as well as two shoulder buttons to dictate how high or low the ball bounces. Most of the time, you can sort of steer the ball the way you want to, but it usually feels like you're trying to steer a ship with broken equipment, praying it reacts the way you want it to and struggling to correct it when it doesn't. You eventually have to putt the ball into a hole, but if there's an unobstructed path (one devoid of unbreakable objects), you can just push forward on the analog stick and the ball will zip right in, smashing through smaller debris along the way. But if higher scores and rankings are what you seek, you may decide to bounce your ball off of walls or hit it into the air and attempt to drop it in the hole for an added bonus--sometimes you're left with no other option. There are rare levels filled with dozens of holes, where putting is your only objective. With a limited amount of balls in hand, you need make sure your shots are true--or at least pray they are lucky--in order to avoid running out while frantically taking aim at targets near and far. Pure putting levels lack the destruction found in standard outings, but they stand out as the best Dangerous Golf has to offer. In these moments, your goal is clear, and more importantly, your controls are intuitive. The oddball nature of Dangerous Golf is momentarily enjoyable, but apathy quickly sets in as you proceed to smash familiar objects level after level, resulting in all too familiar chaos. The game attempts to liven up your experience by introducing gimmicks like bombs, and showering you with loud graphics and sound effects. But all of this does very little to make the experience appealing in the long run. It's like a comedian who shouts mediocre jokes--being loud doesn't make the material any better. With 100 levels and far fewer unique locations, Dangerous Golf is best enjoyed in small bursts lest you grow bored of the repeated use of familiar maps. However, any amount of time in the game can prove frustrating due to the burden of long load times, especially when you get to the more complex missions. In later levels, you're still smashing objects like you always have, but you ultimately have to learn to avoid hazards and direct your ball on a particular path in order to hit specific objects to earn enough points for a medal. When precision fails, you will naturally restart the level. This process becomes unbearable--it seems the game is completely reloading the level--and you have to stare at the same loading screen every single time. To make matters worse, the loading screen is just an image of the controller with button descriptions. Buried in the corner are little hints--the only attempt the game makes to explain its nuanced scoring and control systems. Dangerous Golf is a game you want to love, but it becomes increasingly difficult as you go: the unintuitive controls stop being cute and begin to become an annoyance; the objects you smash, which for a moment inspired joy, become an afterthought. Wacky games have a place in gaming, but a game like Dangerous Golf needs more than boisterous effects and odd scenarios to sustain its allure.","Dangerous Golf is an irreverent, silly, fun approach to golf games that challenges players to break the rules and wreak havoc on more than 100 holes in four unexpected locations.",3.7
39,Daniel Starkey,,8,Hearts of Iron IV,"Jun 6, 2016"," War is tricky business, and when your conflict stretches to the globe’s far-flung corners, it gets that much tougher. That’s what Hearts of Iron IV is all about. You command one of the world’s many countries (you can play as just about any nation that existed during World War II), and your goal in this grand strategy game is to survive the coming storm . Different players will have different preferences--you can be as dove or hawkish as you like--and Hearts of Iron will support you. It’s easy to muck with the flow of history, and in doing so unearth brain-bending strategic challenges that allow you to tell your own story of an alternate version of World War II. I started as the United States in 1936, and I decided that I wanted to doggedly pursue nuclear weapons. I set my sights on having a stable of city-busting bombs ready to go by 1942--three years before their real-world deployment. With careful choices--namely an eye for research, and carefully hiring top scientists like Robert Oppenheimer (a noted historical nuclear physicist), I pulled it off. But, in so doing, Italy went largely unopposed in its campaign in Africa. I hadn’t given much thought to the development of the world’s stage or the early theatres of war and as a result, some things got a little out of hand. With Italy pulling resources from Africa, it managed to shore up the largest army in the world, which the emerging Mediterranean superpower used to bolster Hitler’s advance into France and Russia. France collapsed under the pressure, but the USSR made some stunning choices. Joseph Stalin started a smattering of other wars across the globe, making and breaking alliances to keep global pressure up on Germany. In so doing, they managed to reverse the results of the Spanish Civil War, push heavily into the Pacific and ultimately got into a tussle with the UK and myself. That’s the power of Hearts of Iron IV. This isn’t just an alternative perspective on history-- it gives you the agency and tools to influence one of the world's most turbulent eras in any way you’d like. Each move, every military press, has ripple effects that cascade outward for years. Hold a garrison in one place, and you could cause the world to tremble down the line. This is the butterfly effect made manifest, but there’s a catch: you’re not the only one making choices. The AI responds based on your threat, and who they’re working with. In the real world, the Alliance between Western and Eastern Europe against Hitler was the most tenuous of friendships, as evidenced by the Cold War just a bit later. And that comes down to a fundamental difference in ideology--England and its capitalist friends fundamentally disagreed with the Soviets on everything except that Hitler had to be stopped. So if Germany doesn’t present the same existential danger, why shack up with the Allies at all? As was the case in the actual mid-20th century, Hearts of Iron IV pulls the perspective on war all the way out. There are no individuals here, only numbers. The stories of individual soldiers--with rare exceptions for skilled combatants--get lost in the spreadsheets. The challenge of shifting millions of men and their gearacross the world to battle ideas and their followers is all that matters. Germany, England, Ethiopia, and everyone else cease to be collections of people. They are goals, they are potential boons, and they are obstacles. This is war at its highest levels. This is the essence of what it means to dedicate a nation--everything about its economy, infrastructure, government, and ideology--to the cause of conflict. It’s a callous perspective, but it’s one that keeps Hearts of Iron IV focused amidst such complexity and variability. This is war at its highest levels. This is the essence of what it means to dedicate a nation--everything about its economy, infrastructure, government, and ideology--to the cause of conflict. That’s a lot to manage, but Hearts of Iron IV helps you direct the chaos. Production, research, and deployment of forces are all straightforward. You can queue up the equipment you’ll need to supply your campaigns and these lines grow more efficient with time. Most of the smaller stuff will end up in a nebulous “stockpile.” As you conscript and train new soldiers or armored divisions, your gear will be automatically shifted to where it’s needed most. You can adjust supply priority, however, so if you’re trying to fulfill America’s role as the arsenal of democracy, you can prioritize delivery to England and France over your own warriors stationed at home. Bigger weapons like planes and ships are a bit more hands-on, as you can’t very well keep a nebulous stockpile of battlecruisers and bombers. Instead, they’re attached to airports and naval bases. Each of which has a maximum capacity. From there you can direct your fleets and wings on myriad missions, safeguarding supply vessels or intercepting enemy bombers. Hearts of Iron IV embodies the hard truths about all-consuming war and the international politics that guide it. Even under the best conditions, sending a detachment of soldiers across the world can take months. Aircraft carriers and the flotillas they rely on--packed with destroyers, support crews, battleships, and submarines --take years to build. Your plans have to match that timescale. You can’t just spam marines and call it a day. Instead, Hearts of Iron IV asks you to formulate strategies and stick them through to the end. Your factories spool up their output very slowly, becoming more and more efficient the longer you keep them running. As you start to roll out your gear and mobilize your nation, you face a constant stream challenges you couldn’t have expected months or years prior. If your foes have been steadily outfitting their soldiers with armor-busting anti-tank weapons right as your new Tiger tanks hit their borders, you’ll face some tough decisions about how to adapt. Shifting your production doesn’t come without cost, so which pieces of your plan do you shuck and which do you hold? These questions are the foundation of Hearts of Iron IV. They can strain the most Machiavellian of tacticians, highlighting the disconnect between planning, action, and results to keep the game consistently engaging. No two games will ever work the same way. In some, you might find the Soviet Union holding Germany at Warsaw--for years. In others, Poland’s plan to unite Eastern Europe will work and they will grow to be one of the war’s biggest players. When you look back at it all, you will be able to understand how you got to that point and how things might have gone differently. Even if you’re used to this sort of romp, it can take a dozen hours or more to get the hang of it. Heart of Iron’s only weak point is its tutorial. With so much to manage and so many moving pieces to keep track of, it does a poor job of getting new players ready. To be clear, it’s much more friendly than its predecessors, but this is a game with daunting depth. You can organize everything from division templates to government officials and your war cabinet. Plus, you can play from the perspective of just about any country--each with their own goals and needs--the US, as the world’s industrial powerhouse, is a far different beast to Switzerland. Hearts of Iron IV keeps both interesting and engaging, throwing plenty of important decisions at its players regardless of nation or faction, but digging into the guts of it takes time--a lot of time. Even if you’re used to this sort of romp, it can take a dozen hours or more to get the hang of it. For the dedicated, Hearts of Iron IV could end up being the best grand strategy game in some time. It’s many disparate pieces harmonize, and your decisions, and the responses of foes and allies, are different each and every time. While human drama might get lost in the spreadsheets and figures, there’s nothing quite like seeing the culmination of a strategy you’ve invested in since 1936 pay its dividends in 1945.

40,Peter Brown,Everyone 10+,5,Mighty No. 9,"Jun 21, 2016"," Mighty No. 9 might not bear the Mega Man name, but there's no escaping the fact that it's a spiritual successor of the classic side-scrolling series. You run, jump, and shoot at enemy robots through a series of 2D levels, and for every boss you defeat, you gain a new ability to use during the rest of your journey--that's not to mention longtime Mega Man producer Keiji Inafune is at the helm. It's a cartoony and light-hearted adventure, and if you enable the chiptune soundtrack, it's bound to trigger nostalgia for anyone who has fond memories of Capcom's blue bomber. There's more to Mighty No. 9 than elements of Mega Man, however: you're encouraged to be fast and efficient. You could argue this is just an echo of the Mega Man X games--where skillful dashing was required in order to complete certain levels or to reach secret areas--but Mighty No. 9 rewards quick and nimble play in a new way by allowing you to absorb particles from damaged enemies that temporarily enhance your speed, armor, and power. These boosts have an immediate and tangible effect, and the more you play, the more skilled you become at both acquiring and using them. Mighty No. 9's sense of speed evokes intermittent exhilaration and its nostalgic elements can be charming, but these spurts of joy aren't enough to carry the game in the face of its standout issues. Its levels are are too basic and leave you hungry for something new and exciting; the biggest threats are instant deaths from pitfalls and spikes. As long as you play smart and with a measure of patience, it's very hard to fail. There are a total of 12 stages in story mode, with four that unlock after you finish the initial eight. These eight levels can be tackled in any order you wish, but don't mistake this open-ended level selection as a true callback to Mega Man's punishing structure, where you had to decipher the ""correct"" path through stages and ultimately bosses. Mighty No. 9's bosses can all be defeated using your default weapon with reasonable effort, and thus you rarely feel compelled to explore your weapon upgrades out of necessity. The last four stages are an exception, where particular obstacles demand the use of one weapon or another, but at that point, you have no attachment to your newfound tools, and thus only a vague sense of pride in your progress. At the end, you have no attachment to your newfound tools, and thus only a vague sense of pride in your progress. The real challenge lies in earning high ranks; killing groups of enemies in a specific way that earns you accolades is an ever-present objective. Marks are determined by factors like how much damage you take, how many enemies you kill, and how efficient you are at absorbing their energy. There are also discrete challenge stages with rules and victory conditions that force you to think on your feet, putting your reflexes and problem-solving skills to the test. Sadly, there aren't enough of these--or variety of rulesets--to sustain their budding allure. Perfecting your reflexes is a fun pursuit if only because of the rewarding feelings you get from chaining together attacks and dashes in a fast and stylish manner, but it's nothing more than a convenient way to spice up Mighty No. 9's typical action. Despite its traditional gameplay, there are some noticeable efforts made to modernize the experience; everything is modeled in 3D, including cutscenes where the hero Beck and other characters plan actions and analyze the overarching conflict. At best, the game's 3D models look like sharp and expressive recreations of classic game art, but Mighty No. 9 mostly feels like a compromised effort, failing to deliver either contemporary flair or classic whimsy. Given this, it's more maddening that some levels exhibit a surprising amount of slowdown, though it becomes clear why certain lighting and particle effects are used sparingly; the game isn't optimized to support them throughout. The aforementioned cutscenes are particularly disappointing, with characters that simply sway in place as they talk through static mouths. You can choose to hear dialogue in either Japanese or English, but expect to switch to Japanese regardless of your habitual preference; the English voice acting is too slow and abrasive to stomach. The best moments that relate to Mighty No. 9's characters or plot come during levels, when allies pop in to offer encouragement and dismantle basic obstacles. These cute moments show signs of promise, but Mighty No. 9 doesn't encorporate its thoughtful touches into the bigger picture. Mighty No. 9 is an inoffensively average game sprung from the memories of the past, with little to show for its position in the present. For a game that's meant to bear the legacy of a classic series, Mighty No. 9 barely succeeds. It may rouse excitement from time to time, but by and large, it lacks a pervading sense of artistry, both in its level design and presentation. Platformers--and even Mega Man-like games in particular--are readily available. For one to stand out and leave a mark, it has to do something novel that speaks to the player and the conventions of the genre; something to spark wonder and excitement.

41,Alexa Ray Corriea,Teen,8,Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE,"Jun 24, 2016"," Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE, the long-awaited mashup between Shin Megami Tensei developer Atlus and the Fire Emblem creators at Intelligent Systems, occasionally feels a bit too ambitious for the amount of boxes it's trying to tick. It's the plot of an SMT game--demons invade from another realm and attempt to control our world--with Fire Emblem characters portraying said demons, veneered with the color palette of a Lisa Frank folder and a J-pop-centric story. The relationship-building and demon-recruiting elements of SMT and its spin-off Persona series are present, but the rest is unmistakably Fire Emblem: the weapon and skill upgrades system, mastering and changing classes, the rock-paper-scissors weapon triangle. It's not that there is an overwhelming amount of things you need to complete in Tokyo Mirage Sessions; other than the main story and a handful of side quests, there isn't much to explore. But the tasks it does ask you to accomplish are challenging (and silly) enough to hold your interest. The story itself is a bit of a cheesy mess, but it commits to itself so seriously it's difficult not to get wrapped up in the drama. Teens Itsuki and Tsubasa find themselves pulled up in an otherworldly war. Fire Emblem heroes and enemies appear as otherworldly beings called Mirages, who are stealing people's Performa--the creative spirit that resides in singers, actors, and other entertainers--and collecting it in a bid to take over the world. Shibuya, Tokyo is rife with these beings, and those who can control Mirages are called Mirage Masters. Itsuki and his gang recruit the likes of Chrom (Fire Emblem: Awakening), Caeda (or Shiida from Shadow Dragon), Tharja (Awakening), and Tiki (a recurring series character) to help them defeat the evil Mirages and save Shibuya from certain destruction. At first glance the Fire Emblem characters, redesigned with much darker looks (just see what they did to Chrom), seem a bit out of place in the technicolor-pop world of #FE's Shibuya. But rather than simply shoehorn their appearances in, the game uses them in the same way demons and Personas are used in the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona franchises. Each Mirage is attached to one character, and the pair level up alongside each other through combat. Antagonists from the Fire Emblem series show up as enemy boss fights, including Aversa and Gangrel from Fire Emblem: Awakening, and even side characters like Anna make brief appearances as Shibuya shop clerks. The way the Fire Emblem cast is used is creative, and after a while you'll be able to look past the twisted, dark art style that characterizes their looks for #FE. The majority of your time in #FE is spent in dungeons. Each takes on a unique appearance--one is the set of a Japanese culture film, another an eerie television studio--and features its own twist on environmental puzzles. One area requests you find and help small groups of Mirages by lighting lamps in their dressing rooms; another is more complicated, requiring you crack a numerical code to determine which doors in a given area will let you advance. All of these tasks might be completed while fielding off random encounters, as enemy Mirages will appear and attack without warning. These dungeon puzzles can take some time to unpack and require you to pay close attention to your surroundings. At first I was frustrated with the difficulty of some of them, writing them off as tedious since they require a lot of backtracking through areas on foot. There is very little direction on where to find things, like hidden walls to new areas, and although this wandering is required it's refreshing in that at no point does the game hold your hand. The deeper I went into the game, the more challenging the puzzles became, and in the end I enjoyed their trials almost as much as I enjoyed combat. But Tokyo Mirage Sessions' gorgeously-animated turn-based battles are where the game really shines; it's a delight to watch Tsubasa, clad in her Pegasus Knight getup, backflip into the arena and stab an opponent before Kiria preps an ice spell and blasts the enemy into oblivion. Fights are fun to watch, as our heroes and enemies dance in a flurry of attacks around each fighting arena. Some special attacks can trigger a Session, which essentially allows you extra turns as each hero character gets in an extra hit on an enemy. The way battles are set up, with difficulty scaling up the deeper you get into the game, encourages you to take your time in seeking out attacks that trigger a Session. This, coupled with elemental weaknesses and resistance in some enemy types, creates layers to each battle requires you take time to carefully plan out attacks two or three turns ahead. It's a strategy-oriented battle system, and feels like Fire Emblem in that you have to to consider both hero and enemy placement as well as what weapons and magic your team currently has at their disposal. Sometimes, however, boss battles feel more like a war of attrition than a fair fight. Even when I was overleveled, I had difficulty with some late-game battles involving a boss that continuously multiplied himself or another that required me to kill three creatures at the exact same time or they would keep reviving. Other bosses just had a stupidly high amount of health and no real attack pattern, and dragging out a fight with such dull rules doesn't making overcoming the conflict rewarding. Outside of dungeons, you can take time to upgrade your passive skills--called Radiant--and weapons--called Carnage. Both are upgraded by collecting Performa and detritus from the enemies you defeat. Many special skills are tied to the narrative and require characters to meet certain level or story-focused milestones before they become available, but weapons can be levelled up through regular combat. Each weapon, once mastered, will grant the character access to new skills, and you are encouraged to swap to a new weapon immediately after mastering an old one since you can now move on and diversify your skillset with another weapon. This system isn't complex but it is rich, as each weapon can imbue a character with new or more powerful healing or elemental abilities, depending on your choosing. For example, I made sure to equip Tsubasa with spears that taught advanced healing and elemental spells, and by the end of the game she was a caster to be reckoned with. You can pick and choose which skills to learn and which to forget, allowing for a range of customization in each character's repertoire. Mirages, too, can change their class using a Master Seal, and upgrading a Mirage class affects the power of the user. For example, upgrading Chrom to a Great Lord class heightens Itsuki's attack power and unlocks new, more powerful special abilities. Levelling up Mirages, unlocking and crafting new weapons, and cherry picking what skills to learn is all ripped from the Fire Emblem series, and it is expertly grafted onto Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Juggling all this requires some careful planning, but the payoff in battle is truly satisfying. And when you're not in battle or running around dungeons, you're spending time with your comrades in Shibuya. The city isn't as open-world as perhaps you'd like, with traversal between buildings in the city relegated to fast travel. You can explore Central Shibuya on foot, but there are unfortunately few NPCs to interact with and you are stuck on the sidewalk, navigating the spaces between item shops. Tokyo Mirage Sessions uses the Wii U GamePad like a cell phone, where text messages from your companions will occasionally appear. Sometimes these texts will indicate a new side quest, where you can strengthen your relationship with your friends similar to the Social Link from the Persona games. Side stories typically involve some running around Shibuya with one companion, followed by brief dungeon time and a mini boss battle. These quests add depth to Tokyo Mirage Session's story, and give you additional chances to level up your Mirages and gear. Tokyo Mirage Sessions #Fe is gorgeous, fun, and a smart collaboration all around. Backtracking through dungeons and running up against tedious bosses can bring the momentum down, but overall the game is something worth exploring. After a few dozen hours the semi-ludicrous story and systems set in front of you feel so comfortable together that this mashup of developer Atlus' most popular franchise and Intelligent Systems' beloved strategy RPG seems like it was destined to be.","Set in modern Tokyo, young people come together to weave an epic tale along- side heroes from an alternate world. This brand new RPG, developed by ATLUS, is infused with elements of the popular Fire Emblem series.

42,Alex Gilyadov,,6,The Way,"May 19, 2016"," A lone man stands tall among hundreds of gravestones. His hunched shoulders and back, and the slight grimace on his face indicate the burden of impending peril. He grabs a shovel and starts digging. You can spot an intimidating city skyline in the distance, with gloomy clouds suffocating the sky. Eerie, synthetic piano notes play in the background. “Her grave..,” the man whispers. He quietly moves through the cemetery, beginning his tumultuous journey to discover a way to bring back the dead. What is the meaning of life, and how far would you go to hold onto your loved ones? The Way asks these two age-old questions throughout its intriguing narrative. The premise is simple and familiar, but The Way sprinkles enough clever story beats and surprises to avoid predictability. The beginning chapters show promise, offering inventive puzzles that make great use of your character’s strengths and weaknesses. These obstacles require patience, thought, and the ability to accurately retrace your steps. The puzzles during the game's opening hours range from simple tasks, such as deciphering riddles and acquiring precious passwords, to unlocking hidden doorways and passageways in dangerous locations. Early on, you sneak into a security building crawling with deadly robots and cameras armed with lasers. Avoiding the detection while crawling through vents and hitting switches makes for thrilling James Bond-esque moments. All your character can do at this point in the game is jump, crawl, and fire a gun--if he has one. It’s this simplistic approach that makes The Way a momentarily delightful experience. One early challenge requires you to find a way to disable streams of water so you can reach your destination. There are curious, bright green numbers placed above each stream. Switches that stop water from flowing are hidden in a different room, and also have the same numbers. I had to figure out in what order to hit the switches based on their placements above each stream. It took some time to solve, but it felt gratifying when I finally did. The Way unfortunately devolves from this type of level design in favor of mundane trial and error. Where the earlier puzzles give subtle clues, later obstacles offer almost nothing in the way of hints or direction. You’ve no knowledge to refer to, and you end up stuck on a puzzle that can only be solved through banal repetition. The Way further discourages you when it combines these poorly-designed obstacles with haphazard mechanics. At one point you acquire the ability to use a shield that deflects laser beams. The shield, when deployed, is difficult to wield with skill, and it has to recharge between uses. One of the worst puzzles in the game tasks you with precisely deflecting lasers with your shield towards small tiles in order to create a complicated circuit. This took me an hour to solve due to the cumbersome nature of the shield, and because I had no clue which tiles to hit first. This bogged down the game's swift pace. From then on, the puzzles grew progressively more boring and confusing. Thankfully, the story and characters are fascinating enough for you to keep playing. The small handful of characters you meet along your journey are all eccentric, and play a vital role in the plot. A group of barbaric, colorful villagers you encounter in an ancient village wear strange masks, and can’t speak English very well. You also partner up with an orange behemoth-like creature nicknamed “Tincan.” The highly detailed, pixelated settings and character models, and the synth-like sci-fi musical score further enrich the excellent worldbuilding and storytelling. No environment or level looks the same, from decaying graveyards and ancient caverns, to sunny sand-swept deserts and bright green forests. Making your torturous, long trek across planets and galaxies to discover the key to the afterlife can be fascinating. It's a psychological examination of the human spirit and mind, and what we’re truly capable of when we can’t accept our losses. You have to spend several hours solving frustrating puzzles to see it through, but The Way’s poignant story is worth the occasional struggle.  ",,7.5
43,Justin Clark,Teen,7,Trials of the Blood Dragon,"Jun 13, 2016"," Trials of the Blood Dragon is one of those concepts you didn’t realize you wanted until it was staring you in the face. Far Cry: 3 Blood Dragon's over-the-top setting deserved an encore, but it couldn't just be another first-person shooter--cue the whacky dirtbike racing-meets-platformer series, Trials. Trials of the Blood Dragon takes place some years after Blood Dragon’s ending. Rex “Power” Colt has retired from the Blood Dragon killing business with his wife, Dr. Elizabeth Darling, and has two kids: Slayter and Roxanne. When Dr. Darling disappears mysteriously, and Rex dies fighting Vietnam War 4 by himself, the kids--now smart-aleck teenagers--are recruited to take up the family business of defending America. The first few stages take place in a rendition of Vietnam bathed in sunlight and explosions. You steer a stunt bike over steep, rolling hills, in theory making sweet, impossible jumps and flips. But because Trials of the Blood Dragon requires surgical precision, you will likely spend an equal amount of time failing and picking up the pieces as you familiarize yourself with the controls. Compared to previous Trials games, the tutorial here is a bit lacking, but the game balances that out by having a steadier learning curve than previous Trials games. The difficulty of missions increases in gentle increments, easing you into mastery. The pacing might run the risk of boring veterans if the game didn’t have its share of tricks up its sleeve. After a few levels, you acquire a gun, and for a short time, the gunplay is a fine fit, with a reasonably small selection of targets to hit while riding your bike and targetting with the right analog stick. However, there comes a time when you have to ditch your bike. In these few, scattered stages, you control Roxanne on foot, and the game becomes a twin stick platformer. The mix of platforming and shooting during these missions is a counterintuitive mess, where you can use the X button to jump, but can’t shoot at the same time. All the while, your enemies have spectacular aim, and you don’t have the time to stop and shoot. Not all of Trials of the Blood Dragon’s new ideas flounder, however. Later stages swap the guns for a grappling hook. You have to manage momentum and positioning with greater care than usual, but it leads to some tense, heart-pounding moments when speed is a factor--there's an amazing boss fight against Power Ranger lookalikes that makes rather brilliant use of the hook. Roxanne eventually gets to use a radio controlled car built for speed and wild loop-de-loops in a distinct slate of Hot Wheels-inspired courses, adding another appreciable layer of over-the-top action. Trials of the Blood Dragon truly excels once it breaks out of Vietnam. Where Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was a delirious take on cult 80s action, Trials of the Blood Dragon takes wider aim, featuring missions based on action-schlock homages, each with its own wild twist. One stage is a full-blown Hotline Miami hat-tip--complete with animal masks--that climaxes with a full-on drug hallucination level that shifts, rebuilds, and alters gravity on the fly. Another stage is a weird mash up of Big Trouble In Little China and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, complete with a minecart-based platforming. Even with all this, the game manages to maintain a plot. The twins interact during and between levels while non-sequitur Saturday morning commercials intrude at random. It’s a strange, random mix of aesthetics, with the cartoonish twins and live-action commercials vying for attention, but each stage mimicks its source material with style. The wide variety of themes and referenes does a great job of staving off late-game boredom, and the twins are surprisingly enjoyable characters to be around, ribbing and complimenting each other in equal measure, despite the insanity that surrounds them. As with other Trials games, Trials of the Blood Dragon demands frequent replays if you want to get the best rankings and unlockable items. There’s no shortage of goodies to collect, like extra costumes, but the stages are varied enough to be inviting all on their own without the promise of rewards. You will have to contend with boredom during a few unremarkable levels, but the game's fun, mind-boggling stages leave the strongest impression. Whatever mad genius decided to smash the two series together should be commended: the mix is mostly a successful one, and where it fails, it’s at least failure in favor of trying something new.","The year is 2019. Roxanne and Slayter, the offspring of the legendary Rex Power Colt, are going to Vietnam War 4 to save freedom, and save the world.",4.7
44,Alexa Ray Corriea,Teen,5,Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness,"Jun 28, 2016"," It's been seven years since the release of the last Star Ocean game, with tri-Ace and Square Enix's lauded science fiction RPG series laying dormant. Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness (or Star Ocean 5) breaks this silence, but after exceeding 30 hours buried in its beautiful yet barren world it's difficult not to feel disappointed. Its story and characters are underdeveloped, its mission design fluctuates between vapid and downright tedious, and despite gratifyingly complex combat and skill upgrade systems, the game is weighed down by a host of frustrating smaller problems. Broadly speaking, Integrity and Faithlessness is a story about first contact with alien life. Fidel and his childhood friend Miki choose to involve themselves in their home planet's civil war, and along the way discover a bigger problem. Technologically advanced beings from another world have landed on their planet and are using it for nefarious purposes. Along the way, Fidel gathers a ragtag band of scientists, soldiers, and space pilots as he finds, loses, finds again, loses again, and eventually tries to rescue a mysterious little girl named Relia. The first contact story has been done better elsewhere--numerous times over--and the rest of Star Ocean 5's narrative elements fall equally flat. The characters are bland with little to no emotional development, and feel more like a list of tropes than a believable group of friends, making it difficult to care about their trials. Dialogue is about as subtle as a dump truck, and the unfolding plot does a poor job of communicating why these six strangers have decided to band together and risk their lives to save one little girl. There is a lot of melodrama between them with no power behind it. The relationship between Fidel--a late-teens boy--with Relia--who is maybe five years old at most--is particularly distressing, with lines like ""Without you there's no chance I can be happy!"" coloring awkward tonal shifts. They do not grow together; rather they take confusing emotional leaps, and for this reason it is difficult to invest in their journey. The world of Star Ocean 5 is big and beautiful, but feels just as empty as its characters. Open fields of detailed emerald grass shimmer under clear blue skies. Sunlight bounces off rocky mountains in the distance. Deserts are a deep, dark blur of brown as the wind whips sand around your party, and technology labs sparkle and shine with walls of glinting metal and glowing light. These areas are vast, and the dungeons you find hidden in corners of the world are mazes of corridors dotted with treasures. But none of it feels alive. Enemy creatures spawn in clumps at generous intervals throughout each area, but if you leave and come back the same enemies will appear in the same spots without fail. It's a predictable and shallow world, which makes it a chore to complete quests that require a lot of backtracking on foot through the same areas. Most missions, both in the main story and side quests, include a lot of said backtracking, and the game adds insult to injury by not including a readily available world map. There's a local map you can reference, but you can't look at areas beyond it. If you forget where a certain town or facility is, you're doomed to wander until you find it or remember until you unlock fast travel towards the end of the game. It's easy to get lost. You're also prevented from entering certain areas until you've progressed far enough in the story, gating you on a mostly linear path and preventing you from exploring at will. The world looks vast and beautiful, but this rigidity and emptiness makes traversal unenjoyable. Star Ocean 5 is at its best when you're in combat. All characters in your party fight at once, though you can only directly control one at a time. You can swap between characters on the fly, which comes in handy during tougher boss battles where you may want to oversee healing efforts yourself. At its biggest, your party has two casters, two swordsmen, a melee brawler and a ranged attacker--as well as Relia, who can't do anything besides heal. Battles are a flurry of motion and light, and are an absolute delight to take part it. Even longer, tougher boss battles are welcome challenges, and your team dancing around the battlefield in real time is a gorgeous display. That is, if you properly develop and assign combat roles and skills prior to the skirmish. Combat roles are unlocked by defeating enemies and collecting special points. You spend these points on upgrading roles, which determine the behavior of your characters in battle. For example, you can unlock healing roles that prioritize casting spells and assign them all to one character, putting them in charge of buffing the party and debuffing enemies. Or you can give roles that prioritize the use of special attacks to your casters, which insures they keep out of harm's way while still dealing the highest damage. You can also combine points and special items hidden throughout the world to unlock special, more powerful attacks that are unique to each character. These attacks can be lined up so that characters automatically perform them on the battlefield, or manually executed if you switch to a specific character. This all creates deep levels of customization within your fighting party, and taking the time to unlock, develop, and assign combat roles and skills makes fighting a visual treat and a breeze to navigate. Cooking up assignments and strategies before major boss battles was a highlight of my time with Star Ocean 5. Outside of battles, missions suffer from agonizing objectives. Too many large-scale battles come with the caveat of having to protect a certain character from dying while fending off waves of enemies, adding some much-unwelcome tower defense into the mix. Some combat missions involve seemingly never-ending waves of enemies with no direction for defeating them, and so you battle on and on until you realize you have to make an attempt to escape the area. Still others pit you against enemies you can deal no damage too, and force you to burn up your magic and health points until dialogue leading up to the introduction of a macguffin plays itself out. These missions are poorly designed, an egregious abuse of your time and tools, and become wars of attrition very quickly. Side quests also suffer from this tedium. Some involve you conversing with characters in your party to get to know them better. In theory, the more you interact with certain characters, the more likely they are to heal you or assist you in battle, or go into an attacking rage should Fidel be knocked out. I spent a lot of time completing these drab, unentertaining side stories and noticed no difference in how other characters helped Fidel in combat. Maybe I was too busy trying to hear what they were saying over the din of battle, but in truth my efforts didn't feel like they made a difference. Speciality skills--including crafting, scavenging, emoting, and having treasure and enemies appear on the minimap--are unlocked by completing side quests. All of these, with the exception of the first two, are unlocked by completing fetch quests marked on quest boards in every major town. These entail bringing certain items collected on your journey back to the board or hunting down and talking to certain NPCs. There's no way to know if or how you collected certain items, as most of them are obtained through drops from random encounters. There is also no indicator where in the world you can find certain things--you have to do the trial and error on your own and it's nearly impossible to track your progress. It's also possible that you will never unlock certain specialities because you never complete enough or the right kind of quests; I went through the entire game having unlocked a fraction of these specialities. Crafting is opened up by completing a handful of banal fetch quests for a girl named Welch, and the feature itself isn't worth the trouble when you can pick up or buy the most powerful items anyway as you progress through the story. These side quests are a complete waste of time, and you can make it through the game having not completed any. In addition to all this, Star Ocean 5 suffers from some very strange technical issues. Characters constantly talk over each other. Side-conversations begin over talks pertaining to the plot, and if you're talking and run into a random encounter, the conversation will continue beneath the sounds of combat. Too often, while in a boss battle or major conflict, characters would have conversations key to the plot. In these circumstances, unless you've had the foresight to fiddle with the sound settings beforehand, you won't hear any of it. Pivotal conversations were lost to me over the clash of swords and spells, and you can miss important plot points if your subtitles aren't on or you didn't change the audio settings. Oversights like this are unforgivable. Also, Fidel can bump into and physically move NPCs but will walk straight through his teammates like they're ghosts. It's incredibly jarring and pulls your right out of the experience. There is no autosave and the game's manual save points are infuriatingly few and far between. There are also parts of the story where the game actively blocks you from saving. There was a moment between large battles that I ran into an inn hoping to use the save point, but the game wouldn't let me save. When I failed the second battle, I had restart from before the first one, which also included a lengthy, unskippable cutscene that further wasted my time. Running a gauntlet without reprieve is unnecessary, and doesn't serve to add a challenge--only frustration. In the end, Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness' payoff was not worth the time I put into it. The story feels bloated and empty, with no worthwhile emotional payoff in character development or narrative. Combat and its subsequent upgrade systems are genuinely fun, but the overall experience is held back from being great by issues elsewhere. As a fan of Japanese role-playing games, it's heartbreaking to not be in love with Star Ocean 5, but it holds too tightly onto outdated character tropes and concepts--like the unfair save point system--that make it feel dated and out of touch. If you came to this game seeking the epic sci-fi glory of the series' early years, this is not the Star Ocean you are looking for.","Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness is an epic adventure that introduces seamless transitions between gameplay and dynamic cut scenes, adding a new layer of depth and immersion to storytelling in the series. The popular real-time action battle system from previous titles has been overhauled with improved game mechanics and action sequences for a truly uninterrupted in-game narrative.",6.5
45,Alex Newhouse,Mature,8,INSIDE,"Jun 29, 2016"," A world, broken at the hands of technological progress, decays in silence and darkness. Cowed and enslaved people shuffle mindlessly through the streets. Overseers dressed in masks and black clothes stand at the corners, waiting for one of the slaves to fall out of line, watching the soulless masses as they are forced to jump and dance. A featureless boy in the midst of it all walks through this dystopia wearing a red shirt, one of the only touches of color in this oppressive world. This is Inside, the second game from Limbo developer Playdead. Like Limbo, the gameplay is simple: you have to walk, jump, and grab objects in order to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. Ultimately, however, the game is about your journey through a tyrannical, unknowable, and apocalyptic world. Over the course of a few hours, you descend ever deeper into the heart of a malicious and immense construct that threatens to suffocate agency and humanity. Limbo followed a character moving through a strange and primitive land. Death came easily to the character, but it rarely felt like murder. Inside, on the other hand, exudes violence, cruelty, and artifice. The game highlights the old and shattered parts of a society that you discover has been dragged into a hell of human experimentation. As you progress through Inside, you experience stretches of quiet and calm punctuated by flashes of complete absurdity. The game encourages you to relish these often shocking or brutal twists, which incite feelings of revulsion and confusion. They make you want to know more. These moments remain vivid in my memory even a few days after completing the game. A mindless horde of figures followed me off a cliff only to slam into the ground, creating a squelchy pile of flesh. A wispy, feminine creature tenaciously stalked me through underwater regions. I led my character to many deaths that were immediate and gruesome. I loved the game most during its quiet lulls when the oppressive feeling of the world was most apparent, but the in-your-face moments showed a different and darkly comedic side of Inside. I sometimes couldn't help but laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of what it threw at me. Solving puzzles can be as simple as moving a box up to the base of a high ledge in order to jump up to the top, or as complex as synchronizing multiple automatons to flip switches, lift objects, and move carts so that you can open a door. Some early puzzles rely more on cautious movement than logic as you attempt to avoid murder or abduction at the hands of masked figures. Later puzzles, on the other hand, require more patience and thought. Some make you open sequences of doors to move objects through a room, while others require delicately timed jumps or switches to complete. There comes a time when Inside leans too heavily on its puzzles to keep you engaged. In these moments, I felt that my driving motivation had shifted from exploring the world to simply flipping the right switch. It's a problem that plagued Limbo, and Inside nearly falls into a similar trap in its middle act when it takes you deep underground. You must complete the game's most time-consuming puzzles during its most narrative-light sections, and the suspense that the game worked so hard to build nearly falls apart. Fortunately, this issue evaporates as the game enters its final act, when the world and puzzles again form a cohesive bond. Inside is at its best when it doesn't feel like you're doing puzzles at all, but rather avoiding obstacles and finding paths through a dangerous space. As Inside nears its conclusion, the puzzles strengthen the sense of exploration that defines the rest of the game. Much of Inside's success in storytelling comes from its visual design. The game is gorgeous, with a simple but evocative art style defined by muted colors and featureless figures. Gone are the indistinct backgrounds of Limbo; Inside's environments are richly detailed and full of motion and secrets. For example, you might find smoke still wisping from a candle in a recently abandoned room, a truck full of automatons departing right as you enter a new screen, viewing platforms used to watch slaves dance, or the massive shadowy shapes of the compound's machinery looming far off in the background. Inside's use of sound and music is occasionally breathtaking. You never hear voices, but each setting has its own unique noises. As I moved through a forest, pine trees rustled, rocks clacked against each other, and leaves crunched under my feet. In the compound, a pulsing, rhythmic noise accompanied my journey, a constant and unsettling reminder of the world's heartlessness. Music is used sparingly, but when it swells, even minor events like exiting a building became points fixed in my memory. All of it--the setting, the sound, the beautiful art--builds to the discovery of the secret of this compound, but what I found at the end almost ruined the entire experience. Subtlety was thrown out the window and I was left reeling, unable to process the turn. The oppressive, quiet, slow-moving, and mysterious story that dominated most of the game changed in a flash of complete absurdity. I didn't know whether to laugh or yell in horror as Inside twisted in on itself. When the credits began to crawl, I sat in silence for a few minutes, unable to decide what to make of it. But as time passed, those final moments grew on me. I still find the ending somewhat odd, but upon playing through Inside a second time, I found endearing elements that fit with the overall story more effectively than I first thought. The ending is self-aware in a way that is simultaneously overwrought and humorous, poking fun at itself and at Limbo. It's also cathartic, releasing all of the tension that built over the rest of Inside in one scene. This is a beautiful, haunting, and memorable game, a worthy follow-up to Limbo. Its puzzles, although rarely difficult, are engaging complements to the story. The real achievement of this game, though, is the way that it crafts its narrative: detailed environments convey the bizarre world that you travel through; introspective moments are filled with minimalist sound design and just the barest touches of music; and the things you must do to complete your journey force you to confront the realities of humanity, freedom, and existence. The puzzles might not bring you back to play it again, but the opportunity to learn more about the world alone is enough motivation to return to Inside's dystopia.  ","INSIDE is an action-adventure puzzle game, which follows our award winning title LIMBO, released in 2010.",9.1
46,Randolph Ramsay,Everyone 10+,7,LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"Jun 27, 2016"," Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a cultural juggernaut, but it isn't without its detractors. It may be a rollicking adventure, many say, but a lot of it feels like a retread. Characters, locations, and story beats echoed those of the very first Star Wars film, with even the movie's creators acknowledging that there were many (deliberate) similarities between the two. Much the same can be said about Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. As the newest entry in the long-running Lego series, there's more than a touch of the familiar about this game. It's gameplay, puzzles, and basic structure are all well worn, and even some of that trademark goofy Lego humor is starting to feel a little predictable. No surprises doesn't necessarily mean no fun, however. This game isn't a mold-breaker in the same way the superior Lego Dimensions was, but it delivers on its core promise of being an engaging, fun, and charming title that's imminently suitable for families. It's also goofy enough for adult fans of Star Wars to get a few giggles out of. Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens follows the plot of the movie closely, allowing you to play through many memorable sections from the film like the desert planet of Jakku, the lush forests of Takodana, the ground (and the skies) of Starkiller Base, and more. You can play as dozens of different characters from this movie and other Star Wars films, but for the bulk of your first run through of the game's story mode, you'll be in charge of key characters from The Force Awakens such as Rey, Finn, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Poe Dameron, and BB-8. Befitting a title aimed at young children, character controls are simple, and with unlimited lives and immediate respawns, there's no real penalty for death. As is standard with the Lego games, many characters have unique abilities which are used to solve puzzles or access specific areas. Rey, for example, can use her staff as a lever to activate some switches, while Chewbacca is armed with explosives that can destroy certain structures. None of it is too challenging; the game specifically tells you which characters to use to overcome obstacles, and even the more obtuse puzzles usually just involve finding the right object in the world to destroy in order to ""build"" a new Lego structure. But the fun--as in previous Lego games--is in the way you'll have to swap between multiple characters to achieve objectives, such as using BB-8 to maneuver a winch whilst regularly swapping out to Finn to build the rails for the winch to run on. Lego games are built for co-op enjoyment, and The Force Awakens is no different. The puzzles are just hard enough that younger players will require adult assistance to solve, making it an ideal game for some outstanding kid/grown-up game sessions. There’s also a new mechanic added to puzzle-solving--the ability to ""choose"" which Lego structures to build (and the order in which to build them) to solve some puzzles--which adds little to the overall experience. Despite the potential for interesting solutions or a greater variety of outcomes, this new mechanic usually just results in different animations that lead to the same conclusion. It's window dressing and adds rather little to the Lego formula. Combat is the weaker half of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Most enemies in the game can be defeated through simple button-mashing, save for a few bosses that require some loosely timed quick time events to vanquish. There is one new addition to battles here: in some levels, characters can duck behind cover and shoot at enemies (like a Lego version of Gears of War). But the game's concessions to a younger audience make this addition challenge-free. Hitting the left trigger automatically targets an enemy, so there's never any need to actually aim. That formula may be well traveled by now, but it's still a pleasant one to experience, even though a lot of your enjoyment will depend on your affinity for the Star Wars universe (and The Force Awakens in particular). ""Charm"" is a word oft-used to describe the Lego series, and it's still appropriate here. Simple though they might be, I still found delight in many of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens' levels. It was exciting flying Poe Dameron's X-Wing above the lakes of Takodana and over Starkiller Base's thermal oscillator, dogfighting against waves of TIE fighters amidst chatter from my fellow pilots. I also loved controlling both Rey and the stormtrooper she Force-controlled in the movie to escape her imprisonment from the First Order. And while the goofiness in which the Lego games approach their source material has now become somewhat rote, it still elicited several laughs from me. It was funny to hear some ambient chatter from two stormtroopers about one of them achieving a 3 out of 10 ranking in a recent target practice session (a new record, apparently), and I laughed out loud when Kylo Ren, during that pivotal scene in the snowy forest, bemoans not simply walking over and picking up that fallen lightsaber. Trying to use the Force, he says, was just ""cooler."" And I swear there was a gag directly referencing a ""secret"" cameo within the film (that is, a cinematic spy who played a stormtrooper in The Force Awakens). It's little asides like this that make the game enjoyable for grown-up gamers despite the simplicity of play. There are even several extra levels that expand on the events from the film, including a pre-film timeline rescue of Admiral Ackbar from the First Order's clutches and another detailing exactly how Han Solo and Chewie secured those Rathtars in the first place. For Star Wars fans, these are exciting (and apparently canonical) additions, and it's given more authenticity by the inclusion of nearly the entire cast of The Force Awakens, who recorded new lines of dialogue for the game. It's wonderful if you're a Star Wars completionist, but it's also annoying as these new, non-film levels are hard to access. They're locked away until you earn the requisite number of gold bricks within the game, so you're going to need to play a lot of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens to experience them all. Playing a lot of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens won't be a chore, though, especially if you do have a younger partner to take with you on your galactic journey. These Lego games are confectionaries now, little candies that don't have a huge amount of substance but are enjoyable nonetheless. Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't really take you to a new galaxy far, far away, but it's still a pleasant journey.

47,Peter Brown,Mature,3,Umbrella Corps,"Jun 21, 2016"," As a competitive shooter set in the Resident Evil universe, Umbrella Corps faces an uphill battle. Fans of Resident Evil are most likely thinking about the upcoming, horror-focused Resident Evil 7, and competitive shooter fans have a wealth of proven games with thriving communities to choose from. With so much background noise, Umbrella Corps has to do something special to stand out. And it does offer a few promising concepts, but they sit under a flickering spotlight--Umbrella Corps is a forgettable game dominated by bland action and half-baked mechanics. This is a competitive shooter, first and foremost, where teams of three face off in single death elimination matches, or in a series of varying match types, including domination, bounties, and item collection races. Call them what you will, Umbrella Corps' modes are standard concepts that have been around for decades, and players are so fragile that rounds tend to devolve into deathmatch battles regardless of the overarching objective. Single player levels tend to be similarly basic--kill zombies and collect their DNA. Shooting them is an option, but why expend round after round when you can instantly kill targets with a melee attack? It's baffling that a single whack from the butt of your gun will kill zombies faster than a stream of bullets, but it does. The small selection of maps in the game is directly inspired by the last few numbered Resident Evil games, and apart from the presence of zombies and unlockable character skins, are the strongest ties to the series at large. Despite their familiar appearance, the maps' inner-workings have some fresh appeal. While in Umbrella's labs, you can snake through ducts to get the jump on an unsuspecting enemy, or, in the game's outdoor locations, you can scurry up walls to gain a height advantage. In a game where most people constantly sprint and fire, it feels good to be able to disappear into the environment and wait for prey to cross your path; it's also an easy way to bide your time during single-death matches. Umbrella Corps is at its best when it allows you to utilize your surroundings, but this isn't always possible. Most games with a cover system allow you to snap to any structure of a certain size, such as a wall or a crate, but not here--only some objects are eligible, highlighted with a neon outline. Sure, you can hide behind any wall in the face of incoming fire, but only some walls--ordained without discernible rhyme or reason--allow you to enter a proper cover state and fire from safety. Because of this, you quickly learn that relying on cover is a fool's errand. Ultimately, characters move so fast, and kill each other so quickly, that you become accustomed to looking for enemies rather than hunting for cover opportunities. You can kill opponents in three ways in Umbrella Corps: you can shoot them, kill them instantly with a melee attack, or disable their Zombie Jammer and rely on zombies that litter every map to get the job done. Every player has a jamming device on their back, which allows players to move around the map without rousing suspicion from the undead. When it's disabled--triggered by a well-placed shot to a player's back--zombies rush towards their newfound target. This is a great option in theory, but in practice, it's very difficult to execute. Whether you're standing, crouching, or prone--where you slither around like an awkward greased seal--you can cover a lot of ground with minimal effort, which results in a lot of twitchy and chaotic face offs where opponents frantically attack anything that moves. While you can melee enemies with your gun, you might as well equip the Brainer if you prefer close quarters combat. Your Brainer is an overpowered, hybrid scythe-hammer that kills opponents in one hit, so long as they fall in the weapon's generous kill zone, indicated by a HUD projection. Using it comes with a risk--the Brainer's attack animation is notably long--but it's the fastest way to take out an enemy. Should you and a Brainer-wielding enemy attack each other at the same time, you both stagger for a moment before you can issue a follow-up attack. Typically, this results in a flurry of button presses as you try to attack again as soon as the game allows--but with both competitors mashing away, it becomes a game of luck rather than skill. Relent and try to switch weapons, and you'll probably die. Spend too much time trying to issue a counterattack, and you're likely to get killed by an enemy who's passing by. The Brainer is both the most effective tool in your arsenal, and the most likely to get you killed. You can try to adjust your strategy to account for the Brainer's peculiarities, but there's nothing that can be done to combat Umbrella Corps' broken death animations. In some instances, it takes a full second or two for a death to properly register in the game, and in that window of time, the doomed player can attack and kill others before they are disabled. There's probably a joke to made in there about how the dead don't stay dead in the world of Resident Evil, but this is a bug--not a feature--and the final nail in the coffin for a game pitched as a competitive shooter. Determined players can earn cosmetic items and new weapons as they earn XP and level up, but a new gun or patch for your helmet doesn't wash away the bad taste of Umbrella Corps' gameplay. Its systems are either unreliable or illogical, and as a result, it feels almost impossible to get a foothold. The first time an enemy kills you when they should have been dead, you may shrug it off. When it happens the dozenth time, you'll probably wonder why you're playing Umbrella Corps at all. There's ultimately no good excuse.  ","Join the corps!

48,Mat Paget,Teen,5,The Solus Project,"Feb 18, 2016"," The Solus Project is a survival game with a mysterious story to tell. You play as an explorer who crash lands on an alien planet during a search for mankind's next home, and with your survival on the line, you have to traverse a strange, deserted world and find a way to communicate with other voyagers. Along the way, you discover the land isn't as benign as it first seemed; it houses numerous dark secrets. It's an interesting premise that's ripe for excitement and intensity; however, it doesn't come together in a satisfying story and is rarely, if ever, engrossing. The world you're stranded on is bleak and desolate, and the area you explore is a collection of islands, so much of what you see are coastal areas with beaches and large cliffs. You'll also explore creepy caves, which are nigh impossible to navigate without a source of light. The environments don't look particularly outstanding, but some of the weather effects can deliver moments of awe. The first time I saw a tornado, I was left with my mouth open in astonishment. The weather can be daunting and dramatic, assisted by music that swells and crescendoes with the wind. Tornadoes are joined by meteor showers and lightning storms, but the danger of the extreme conditions was moot--it wasn't hard to avoid death at the hands of the vicious weather. The story is delivered through brief and infrequent monologues, and through stone tablets that your computer-like device translates. Much of the storytelling is also conveyed through audio logs your protagonist records. But despite the fact that you come across notably crazy sights, your character almost never acknowledges them when delivering her verbal assessments, focusing instead on minor, seemingly mundane details. While there isn't any combat to speak of, you are in a constant battle to survive, and it's crucial that you stay on top of your hunger, thirst,fatigue, and body temperature. You regain health by sleeping or consuming special items. Monitoring temperatures is a critical task as it's easy to succumb to hypothermia or heat stroke, which can quickly put your life in jeopardy. With the right supplies, you can generate heat or cold as needed. Despite having to manage a host of physical conditions, survival comes easy as long as you pay attention, which unfortunately undermines any feelings of desperation the game attempts to evoke. Your primary objective during missions is typically to get from point A to point B, and though you regularly come across puzzles or obstacles, they're usually easy to resolve. You have access to tools that can help you complete certain puzzles, like a hammer that can break down walls or a teleport device that shoots discs you can teleport to. Some puzzles can be solved through remembering patterns, while others require you to use the teleport device. However, my solutions often felt like I was cheesing my way through the game. In a lot of cases, I would hammer the jump button to slowly but surely make my way up a mountain or constantly shoot the teleporter discs until one finally made it through a crack or over a wall, which would allow me to teleport to them, then move on. Instead of feeling smart after solving a puzzle, I felt like I achieved the solution by pushing on something over and over until it worked. Sometimes you're left to explore rather than chase a distinct objective, and this isn't immediately a bad thing, but The Solus Project does little to inspire you to roam the planet's open spaces. At best your curiosity is rewarded with supplies, tools, or slight stat improvements. I never found myself struggling to survive, so many of these items ended up sitting in my inventory. There are times when you come across items that seem initially useful--like a rope that can be used for climbing--but you may never find a practical use for it. The Solus Project pushes you to explore, but it fails to reward your efforts in meaningful ways. The Solus Project tries to bring story and survival together in an engaging way, but it ultimately falters in this attempt. It has moments of wonder, but they're divided by what is mostly monotonous wandering from place to place. It's a disappointing game with a lot of missed potential, and it doesn't convey a good story or the rewarding feeling of surviving against the elements.","The Solus Project is a first-person single-player survival game, headed to PC and as a console exclusive to Xbox One.",7.4
49,Mike Mahardy,Mature,6,Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma,"Jun 28, 2016"," Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma is a game that refuses to be pinned down. It explores quantum physics and meta probability, horror tropes and memory loss, revealing hidden nuances as it unfolds like an origami swan. There are a slew of minor problems that mire its intriguing story, but nonetheless, Zero Time Dilemma wields complex topics to paint a morbid tale about the essence of human nature. This is the third in a series of adventure games that eschew linear storytelling techniques. As in the first two titles, Zero Time Dilemma focuses on nine individuals who have been locked up by the villain Zero, forced to compete against each other in ""escape room"" puzzle situations. In this case, the victims are trapped in a bomb shelter miles underground--in order to get the six codes necessary to open the exit door, Zero tells them, six people must die. This is the basic setup. From here, though, the story branches in every which direction, doubling back on itself and correcting plot holes that weren't actually plot holes to begin with. At the beginning of each chapter, Zero Time Dilemma asks you to select one of the three teams--each with three members--and play through one of their memory ""fragments."" They're titled as such because at regular intervals, bracelets on the characters' wrists knock their wearers out, injecting memory loss drugs that upend the victims' sense of time. There's no guarantee that you're playing these events chronologically, and the characters know it, too. ""We slept for seven hours,"" one character mutters, glancing at the timer on his bracelet. ""Or,"" says his teammate. ""We woke up several times, and don't remember anything at all."" This facet of Zero's ""game"" creates some of the more horrific and intriguing situations of the story. Teams build up trust between each other, only to forget it all once they wake from a deep sleep hours later--earlier?--and start from scratch. Without memories, is it possible to build trust? ""When we lose our memories, are we reborn?"" a character wonders, in one of the game's more potent moments. Despite the fact that it's up to us who dies, there's still a genuine tension in seeing how characters and teams distrust each other to the point of considering murder. In examining how memories affect our perception of time, Zero Time Dilemma also reaches into more complicated topics about humanity itself. Are we inherently good, capable of altruism in dire circumstances? Or are we animals with predetermined instincts that merely extend our chances for survival? The game raises the question, but doesn't pretend to have the absolute answer. Some characters resort to suspicion and torture, while some rely on the goodness of the other teams, despite the lack of communication between them. Zero Time Dilemma veers suddenly into horror to illustrate the extreme measures some characters will go to, regardless of the guilt they'll feel in the aftermath. While the blatant shocks and sometimes fetishistic gore lend some surprise to proceedings, they often feel out of place--Zero Time Dilemma may be a chaotic collection of memory fragments, but it also struggles to find the right tone. In examining how memories affect our perception of time, Zero Time Dilemma also reaches into topics about humanity itself. What's compelling isn't the story itself, though. The real hook is the actual process of piecing things together. Playing Zero Time Dilemma is akin to reading a book out of order as someone hands you one random page at a time--you can reread pages, absorb new ones, and rearrange them all to make more sense as time goes by. Zero Time Dilemma is the rare game that places structure over substance, and for much of the time, gets by on doing so. But Zero Time Dilemma's structure is so daring that it can't support meaningful character development. The cast wades through expository dialogue and poorly written conversations throughout the majority of the game's chapters, only saying anything worthwhile once you've suffered through boring monologues and cloying clichés. To be clear, the characters' confusion is justified--they don't have memories and prior understanding to fall back on, after all. But their vapid personalities don't make the trek any better. They're one-dimensional mannequins with sometimes shocking secrets to share, but they mainly exist to move the plot forward, backward, sideways and in circles around itself. It's no surprise Zero Time Dilemma relies on its characters for exposition, because its mediocre presentation doesn't help at all. Whereas 999 and Virtue's Last Reward--the previous games in the series--use graphic novel formats to tell their stories, the new entry uses animated 3D cinematics. This is a mistake. I can't decide which is worse: characters' facial animations or their movement. The former consist of blank stares and stiff turns-of-the-head. The latter are extremely limited as well--it feels as if Zero Time Dilemma doesn't know how to portray anything more complex than walking, pointing a gun, or lying on the floor. In fact, often when something momentous is happening, the camera cuts to the same shot of the same ceiling panel, opting instead to convey the scene through audio cues such as gunshots, screams, or explosions. It's telling that the actual escape-room puzzles take such a back seat to the story. This is due in large part to the non-chronological narrative--but also to the inconsistent quality of the puzzles themselves. Many of them are well designed: one particular room with rotating walls toys with your sense of spatial reasoning, while another conveys hints through small statues in various significant poses. Too many of the escape rooms eschew the subtle guidance of a good puzzle, and make the same mistakes as old school adventure games. But too many escape rooms ignore the lessons learned from the missteps of old school adventure games. Too many require constant clicking on seemingly innocuous details on the screen. Too many eschew the subtle guidance of a good puzzle, opting instead to rely on point-and-click mechanics, creating frustration and removing you from the experience almost as much as the poor animation and dialogue do. Nevertheless, my understanding of Zero Time Dilemma during its first hour and my understanding as it came to a close could not be more different. It's a complex narrative built around a chaotic, intriguing structure. It may stumble too many times with its dialogue, fail to find much substance in its characters, and lack any impressive presentation. But it uses that fragmented structure to keep you guessing, and engaged, right up to its numerous depressing, hopeful, gruesome endings.",,8.9
50,Scott Butterworth,Mature,,Tom Clancy's The Division,"Mar 7, 2016"," The Division has undergone several transformations since it first launched back in March, but the core shoot-and-loot setup has remained an exhausting time sink that's both aggravating and exhilarating. Whether you're still smitten with its grindy gear hunting or surrendered to its bullet sponge enemies months ago, the game's first paid expansion--Underground--offers an enticing package that includes new gear sets, a third Incursion, and an entirely new way to engage the game: Underground Operations. According to the simple yet sound story framing, the forces you fought during the campaign have since regrouped in New York's labyrinthine subway system, and it's up to you to flush them out. The resulting missions play like a strictly cooperative PvE version of the more PvP-focused Dark Zone, though Underground's operations function more like a new mode than a new area. Operations take place away from the open-world setting in randomized ""dungeons,"" allowing for discrete, repeatable missions with adjustable difficulty and gameplay variables. Despite being randomized, levels end up looking just as detailed as the desolate city above, with creepy lighting and believable destruction throughout. Areas seem to fit together naturally, too; though I encountered a few strange bottlenecks and began to recognize certain reused sections after several hours, I was consistently impressed with the variety of the level layouts. And although Underground's tunnels are populated with the same enemies you fought topside, they've developed some new tricks that noticeably impact the flow of combat, namely alarms, environmental traps, and jammers that disable your special abilities. For even greater variety, you can apply any combination of Underground's five ""Directives"" to any mission. Each one handicaps your team in some way--from disabling the mini-map and directional damage indicators to steadily draining your health as you play--but all of them grant you bonus loot and XP if you're successful. It's a clever way to add an enjoyable, optional challenge and extend Underground's longevity. Unfortunately, Underground forces you to unlock new Directives one at a time over the course of many, many hours. Given that you can only tackle these missions if you're already a veteran player, this arbitrary gating feels like pure padding. The one upside to the padding: Underground's operations are probably the most reliable source of quality loot in the entire game. Every mission ends with a boss and a loot chest, both of which tend to yield high-end weapons or better, and every time you level up, you're gifted a cache containing a random item. Anyone who's spent days grinding through dailies in order to earn a high-end gun knows exactly how exciting this is, especially since Underground also adds four new armor sets. For the uninitiated, equipping two or more items from the same set unlocks special stat bonuses. In this case, those bonuses boost particular playstyles, subtly but smartly encouraging you to carve out a specific role. One set aids support players by improving the effectiveness of the health station, for example, while another helps damage-dealers by reducing reload times. Each set offers something unique that's worth working towards, which--combined with the addition of weapons and items with a 240 gear score--makes The Division's loot meta-game alluring again. The one annoying drawback to Underground's generous reward system: desirable vendor items still require Phoenix Credits. Even though I had a stash full of high-end weapons, I didn't have enough Phoenix Credits to buy items or blueprints since there's still no way to sell gear for anything besides basic currency. If all this talk of gear scores and Phoenix Credits has you confused, don't worry: Underground actually provides a reasonable re-entry point for lapsed players. You'll be miserable the first couple hours as you try to figure out how the game's changed, but if you overcome this opening hurdle, Underground's gear rewards will catch you up quickly. Solo players be warned, though: every Underground mission is a ""no respawn zone."" If you die without anyone around to revive you, you'll be booted back to base. Honestly, it's not worth playing alone. Beyond its random dungeons and added gear sets, Underground's other major addition is The Division's third Incursion, Dragon's Nest--which, despite some cheap, fiery nonsense, is the strongest of the three. This time around, the usual grenade spam is also accompanied by stealthy, speedy RC cars that explode into flames and, if you're under 200 gear score, will probably down you in one shot. You also have to deal with four simultaneous bosses who emerge from all four corners of a rooftop arena, all while snipers and shotgunners consistently drive you out of cover--pretty frustrating considering The Division's health and damage systems rely on players being able to remain in cover and move tactically between obstacles. I had more than one team give up and disband, which forced me to replay the early portions of the mission with a new squad. In a perverse way, however, the extreme challenge is a good thing. It forces your squad to work together and potentially makes all your loot hunting pay off. I had a respectable 188 gear score when I first attempted the Incursion, but still got repeatedly massacred, as did my teammates. When I tried again later after raising my score to 205--completing a new gear set in the process--I finally managed to dodge enough deadly RC cars to rip through those four bosses. Plus, the final room--which requires you to flip switches while avoiding entire sections of the floor as they burst into flames--is more thoughtful, creative, and distinct than anything we've seen from an Incursion before. It might be a pain, but Dragon's Nest is definitely a step in the right direction. And though not technically part of the paid expansion, it's worth noting The Division's sweeping 1.3 update launched right alongside Underground, adding new weapons, one additional gear set, a special Dark Zone bracket just for players for a gear score of 231 or higher, a Heroic difficulty option for two existing missions, the ability to recalibrate weapon talents, and more. Overall, the 1.3 update so far seems to be a resounding success, balancing out some of the odd changes implemented in the 1.2 update without introducing any major new bugs. So whether you purchase Underground or not, you'll find a Division that's arguably more polished and balanced than ever. But those who do pick up Underground will also find a new way to play. The core mechanics and bullet sponge enemies haven't changed, but the option to engage in short bursts of customizable, cooperative gameplay provides a hugely welcome alternative to simply replaying story missions or struggling through the Dark Zone. The unnecessary leveling system might slow the fun and solo players may suffer, but even Agents diving back in after months away can now enjoy new gameplay variations and the pick-up-and-play nature of Underground's 15- to 20-minute operations. Assuming they haven't burned out entirely, that is.","Tom Clancy's The Division has players take the role of Division agents where they find themselves caught up in an epic conspiracy, forced to combat not only the effects of a manmade virus, but also the rising threat of those behind it.",7.8
51,Joab Gilroy,,6,Dead by Daylight,"Jun 14, 2016"," Horror in games (and films) is too often characterised by jump scares; shocking, startling events designed to trigger a fight-or-flight response. Dead by Daylight, to its credit, eschews these in favour of real horror--a gradual increase in tension resulting from the unshakeable sense of impending doom. That it manages to do this in an asymmetrical competitive action game is what is truly impressive about it. Dead by Daylight features two teams--four survivors and one killer--and pits them against one another in a battle for all the marbles: The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors, knock them down, put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods. The odds are skewed heavily in favour of the invincible killer, and as a result playing Dead by Daylight as a survivor can be a nerve-rattling, sweat-inducing, terrifying experience. After queuing into a game with three other survivors, Dead by Daylight puts you in one of several eerie horror environments--a dilapidated farm, a run-down manor, a rickety junkyard--and tells you, very simply, to fix the generators to escape. When you find the generators, you then need to repair them--a painstakingly slow process, where you hold the left mouse button down while crouching in front of it. If you're alone, repairing the generator can take more than a minute. As you crouch next to the very noisy generator, the game will throw skill-tests at you by way of a rotating bar--if you fail the QTE, the generator will backfire. This creates a noisy explosion, and the killer is visually alerted to the location of the backfire, turning you into a target. If the killer does find you (and he probably will) your options are limited. If you have a flashlight you can blind him temporarily, but your best bet is to run away. The killer moves faster than you can run, maintaining the traditional horror movie 'ominous walk', but you can slow him down by leaping through windows, or pushing down pallets to block his path. You want to put as many of these obstacles in between the two of you as possible as you flee for your life.   Fortunately for the survivors, a sixth sense mechanic alerts them to the presence of a nearby killer--the closer the killer is, the faster your survivor's heart beats. Unfortunately the sound is obscured by generator revving as you repair it. When 90% repaired, the generator nearly drowns out the heartbeat entirely, forcing you to rely solely on your eyes to see the killer. When you play as the killer, you're able to see all the map's generators at all times, allowing you to patrol them. If any of them are making noise, you know at least one survivor has been working on it, and you can hunt for signs that the others are nearby. Panicked survivors will sprint away, leaving scratches on nearby walls and breaks in the grass, and you can follow these markings to find your prey. Once you find your prey you chop them down, pick them up and put them on a hook, sacrificing them to your god after 60 seconds. The scoring system initially encourages players to create exciting gameplay opportunities by rewarding risky play. Survivors who engage in lengthy, drawn out chases escaping the killer will earn more points for their boldness, and you can rack up the points by rescuing other survivors who have been captured but not yet sacrificed. As a killer you're rewarded for killing more of the survivors, although a single sacrifice is counted as a victory. Inevitably though, this scoring system leads to immersion-breaking actions like exploiting the killer's slow movement past obstacles, as survivors earn huge points by taunting their hunter. Another problem for Dead by Daylight is its matchmaking system. The game is entirely peer-to-peer hosted, with the killer hosting the survivors at all times. Unfortunately there's no way to tell where in the world the killer is or whether they're capable of hosting five people in a game until you're playing. There's no ping indicator and no regional matchmaking, so you have to roll the dice each time you join a new server--and if you crap out, you'll warp around the game world barely able to work out what's going on. Further, there's no group-based matchmaking, so you can't queue with friends. This results in players lobby-hopping until they are grouped with friends, which is a terrible experience for all involved. Dead by Daylight executes the concept of a competitive horror game well, but only to a point. As players become more familiar with both roles, the horror dissipates and they begin to play for the competitive element alone. The poor matchmaking and the highly exploitable scoring system make Dead by Daylight less competitive than it should be, resulting in gameplay which doesn't resemble the horror experience it sets out to be.",Four real humans try to escape another who plays an unstoppable killer.,6.4
52,Jason Imms,,8,Duskers,"Dec 31, 2015"," You sit alone and cold on the bridge of your small ship, painfully aware that you’re probably not going to survive the coming days. Your only companions are a trio of drones leftover from your now-forgotten mission. You’ve given them pet names--Hal, Orson, and Colin--and they are your only friends in the universe. And yet you put them in harm’s way. You expose them to unknown dangers while you cloister yourself on your ship. You send them scuttling-off to wring enough precious scrap and fuel from the bones of derelict ships to keep yourself alive, hoping to piece together information on a mysterious cataclysmic event that has seemingly stripped the universe of all other human life. Duskers is a retro-futuristic science-fiction nightmare for anyone that fears being alone--and as best as you can tell, in this world, you are alone. You control your drones by typing into a command-line interface, watching from afar through sensors and cameras as they do your bidding. Duskers couples this control method with an art style that cohesively reinforces the game’s atmosphere, making the player and their physical keyboard an active part of the experience. The game is played from a first-person perspective, and presents itself entirely in-fiction. The primary interface is a 1:1 representation of a computer terminal on board your ship, which you directly manipulate with the physical keyboard on your desk. You never see a digital representation of your hands flying across a keyboard. There are zero layers of abstraction. When you sit down to play Duskers, you are the protagonist. This creates a huge amount of tension. Despite the fact that your drones are the ones facing danger directly, you know that if they're destroyed you won't be far behind. By depriving you the comfort of an avatar to control, each playthrough becomes a harrowing personal experience. Knowledge is power. Over the length of multiple playthroughs you’ll gain knowledge of the cataclysm that has seemingly stripped the universe of all human life bar your own. This knowledge comes in the form of small chunks of information taken from ship logs as you dock with them. Your own player knowledge increases in a similarly piecemeal fashion as you learn how drone and ship upgrades interact, increasing the power you wield over your surroundings. Duskers is a game of methodical exploration. In order to survive, you carefully expand your knowledge of each derelict ship you encounter by scanning rooms, dropping sensors, and when all else fails, simply opening doors and hoping the next room is safe. You start each playthrough with three drones, and a random assortment of drone upgrades. For your first playthrough the tutorial ensures that you have the Motion upgrade, which allows a drone to detect threats in adjacent rooms. This provides a huge amount of situational awareness, making it a tempting must-have. But what if on your next playthrough you don't have the motion upgrade? Or what if it breaks and you can't afford to repair it? Suddenly you're forced to discover new methods for exploring, building on the rules and lessons you've learned previously. Experimenting with new strategies and combinations of upgrades is a huge amount of fun, and mastering them is immensely satisfying. It’s rare to find a ship that isn’t crawling with at least one type of infestation. The first is a swarm of creatures that will take advantage of your every mistake, quickly turning your drones into piles of scrap metal. There are a number of different infestation types, but it would be a disservice to describe them in a review. Learning what an infestation is, how it behaves, and how to dispatch it is a central part of the risk and reward of Duskers. Infestations are terrifying at first encounter, but much like learning to master your upgrades, learning how to handle each infestation type is thoroughly rewarding. You watch over your drones using a schematic view, which provides an overview of the currently-attached ship. It shows the airlock your ship is attached to, the location of your drones, and any rooms, doors, or other items you’ve discovered. The schematic view is an extremely valuable tool, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. Certain actions require you to take direct control over a drone, to understand its immediate surroundings. This is necessary because threats don’t show up on the schematic view unless they’ve triggered manually-placed sensors or your motion detector, and means you’re constantly switching between views, none of which can give you 100% of the information you require in order to survive. It’s frantic and stressful, aligning perfectly with the dire situation at hand. Vigilance is the key to Duskers. You can’t play it effectively when you’re tired or distracted, you need to be fully alert in order to survive. The second your attention wavers, you’ll forget to engage your stealth modification before opening a door to an unscanned room, or simply type the wrong door identifier, opening a room known to contain an infestation. You will fail--Duskers is challenging, and not forthcoming with information on how to improve your abilities. When your time comes you’ll know that it was because you made a mistake, not because the game somehow cheated you. The true pleasure of playing Duskers is in mastering its interwoven systems. When your fingers are flying across your keyboard and drones are dutifully following your every command, Duskers makes you feel powerful. The cold sense of dread the setting provides never really goes away, but as you gain knowledge and resources, your confidence grows. Ultimately, Duskers is about allowing yourself to believe that you're really sitting on a rickety old space ship, with only drones for friends. You're alone, but not without hope. You may not conquer the universe, but you'll eventually learn how to survive it.",In Duskers you pilot drones into derelict spaceships to find the means to survive and piece together how the universe became a giant graveyard.,7
53,Brett Todd,,8,Space Run Galaxy,"Jun 17, 2016"," Long-haul trucking heads to the stars with Space Run Galaxy, a mix of tower-defense strategizing and twitchy arcade action that is surprisingly engrossing. It features a great deal of depth and compelling gameplay that challenges both your brain and your fingers. Broadly speaking, it's a game about running cargo from point A to point B--and sometimes point C or more, since some jobs take you to multiple star systems. You might go to places with names like Station K-2001 and Ceti Station instead of Indianapolis and Boise, and you might haul radioactive barrels and genetic decoders instead of frozen foods and car tires, but the focus here is still all about making deliveries on time with your cargo intact. There are a few key complications, however. Ships in Space Run Galaxy are all built with modular hexes, and you're free to configure them as you wish. Make some cash from your runs and you can add to the basic vessel layout, improving your ship in several ways. You can haul more cargo, outfit your ride with more weapons, add high-tech gadgets like shields and repair units, or install more thrusters for greater speed. All of these add-ons--which are divided into four self-explanatory categories of Offensive, Defensive, Utilities, and Basic--can be purchased from a mechanic when you are planetside for both credits and materials specifically slotted into each of those categories. However, they can only be installed during missions. This adds a sizable tactical layer to the game. As you are always dealing with a limited number of credits and materials, you have to make tough decisions between assignments. Do I go offensive by adding another laser cannon or a missile launcher to my stock? Do I increase the size of my vessel to haul more cargo and install more thrusters for speed? Do I go defensive with another shield or repair unit? The tech tree isn’t spectacularly large or complex, but it offers enough choice to keep you intrigued and constantly customizing your ship to meet the demands of the spacelanes. Said demands can be quite grueling, too. Unlike the average trucker on Earth, who faces hazards like tire blow-outs and the lure of wasting too much time in Denny’s, every route in Space Run Galaxy is strewn with asteroids, murderous pirates, and potentially hostile aliens. Even though your ship basically runs on a pre-determined path during each run, there is a lot of action here as you build the aforementioned weapons, shields, thrusters, and so forth to address threats. Incoming bad guys, space rocks, and the like are depicted on the main screen along with a meter that shows which way they are coming from and how long you have until the threats are upon you. This makes for some white-knuckle rides, as you need to make sure that your ship is well-equipped to deal with these problems in advance. While you may start a mission with a measured approach--dropping in a laser cannon here and a shield generator there--very soon you’re scrambling to meet increasing threats as they slowly slide into range and start wrecking your vessel. There is no pause button, so everything has to be tackled in real time. Hexnuts--the game's form of currency--always seem in short supply, which means you have to be really careful with what hardware you choose to install or else you run the risk of being defenseless when a bunch of enemy drones show up. Speed is also a big concern. Every mission must be completed before a timer expires, and you'll need to combat this by adding thrusters to your ship. Of course, this forces you to engage in a balancing act between prioritizing offense and defense as the limited number of hexnuts makes it very difficult to cover all of those bases and keep up your need for speed. About the only drawbacks here are repetition and occasionally wonky difficulty. Every mission takes you back to the drawing board with a clean ship that needs a fresh install of all weapons and gear. This is unavoidable given the core design of the game, although it still forces you to endure repeat actions with every assignment. Difficulty is more hit-and-miss than a steady progression, due to what seems to be a big disparity between story missions and respawning basic cargo runs. You can do one easy haul after another, then run into a brick wall of an insane job where you get confronted by multiple enemy gunships or aliens that cut you to ribbons. This actually increases the sense of repetition, as you need to grind out a lot of these basic cargo runs to earn the credits and goodies that are needed to upgrade your ship into a killer vessel able to handle such enemies. Missions are speedy, though, so you never feel like the game is dragging. The game has a real “just one more turn” vibe. Multiplayer is incorporated here to provide the feel of an expanded universe. This is an interesting idea, clearly based on the appeal of setting up a full market system for players where they can interact, sell and buy goods, and even help one another out with delivery runs. That said, multiplayer seems to exist right now mainly as a way to pick up the odd run for extra credits or equipment. And since many missions allow you unlimited respawns, there isn't any real reason to take on these multiplayer offers unless you happen to be going in the right direction and have the room for a little extra cargo. Even though it's repetitive and occasionally frustrating, Space Run Galaxy is a great way to, as Deep Purple puts it, “go space truckin’ round the stars.” Tactical depth, a wide range of choices when it comes to customizing your ships, and a liberal dose of frantic action during cargo runs--not to mention a good sense of humor and attractively cartoony visuals--combines to deliver an experience that isn't easy to master, but one that's worth the extra effort.

54,Justin Clark,,7,I Get This Call Every Day,"Dec 21, 2012"," There’s a famous concept among historians: the banality of evil. The idea states that when atrocities occur, when decisions are made that will have far-reaching, crushing consequences, they won't come from some criminal mastermind or grand Machiavellian scheme. More often than not those decisions will be the work of a perfectly average mind, motivated by utterly mundane motivations. The historian who coined the phrase was talking about one of the high ranking officers of the Third Reich. What developer David Gallant taps into with I Get This Call Everyday is much smaller in scale, but likely hits closer to home: the effects of unyielding, never-ending, everyday belligerence on the human spirit. And whether you want to admit it or not, chances are, you were that evil to someone very recently. How? You picked up the phone. I Get This Call Everyday is, on the surface, like many choose-your-adventure, Twine-crafted titles in recent years: an exercise in empathy, in which players inhabit a crude, MS-Paint mockery of a customer service environment. You are the voice on the other side of the telephone, armed with naught but a computer designed only for accessing customer information. In this particular instance, you’re working customer service at the Canadian equivalent of the IRS. The game has but one caller: an early-20-something named Billy Swarth calling in with a relatively simple request: a change of address. I Get This Call Everyday is about the folks who provide the service. This is about the person you stopped thinking about the second that phone went click. This is about the person who will have to go through that exact same song-and-dance 50-100 times more that same day, and not slip once into a natural, human response, no matter what measure of abuse or ignorance comes out of that phone. From the customer side, this should logically be a two-minute interaction: Tell the representative your name, tell them your new address, “Thanks”, click. From the agent side, it’s a different story. Many interactions may go smoothly, but just as many are impenetrable labyrinths of interrogation. Even getting to the correct account requires the exact name entered, which might not show up because the customer used a nickname/common name instead of their birth name. The customer might give their birthday, but might not give you their year or any other identifying information. Their address may be someplace they lived five years ago, and somehow, they can’t remember what that address was, and get spontaneously angry at the poor sap who’s just trying to find their info. The action the customer’s trying to perform might require answering security questions which the customer made when they were 16-years old, and have since forgotten. This is the experience I Get This Call Everyday manages to translate admirably, given the simple tools on display. It’s really just a series of dialogue choices--often binary, but also fairly true to life--leading to an ending of some sort typically within about 2-5 minutes per call/playthrough. But this isn’t a game of winning or losing, or even of getting closure to a story. The goal here is to carefully extract the exact information needed to process this customer’s request while maintaining professionalism in the face of an enemy. And that enemy is Billy Swarth. Billy is the petulant bane of a customer service rep. He doesn’t know most of his information, gives terse answers to every question, and gets mad at the rep for daring to try and dive deeper. He also doesn’t keep or have access to any of the necessary information foreven basic business with his account:“I don’t know, my mom handles all this for me.” Billy is a puzzle box where the puzzle has no real solution, and yet the puzzlemaster berates you for not being able to solve it. Billy is simply terrible. And yet, therein lies the evil. While basic empathy or understanding from Billy might’ve helped make this interaction a little easier to bear, there is almost no understandable human reaction in this game that will get the player anything but fired by the nigh-omnipotent manager listening in on the call. Skipping the verification process? That’s a firing. Providing customer info to just push them to the next step? That’s a firing. Getting the customer angry enough to escalate to a supervisor? That’s a firing. Responding the customer insulting you? Oh you best believe that’s a firing. No, to be effective here is to maintain professionalism at the cost of any semblance of humanity, for no reward except being cursed at by the person you are attempting to help. If the Steam achievements can be believed, there is a way to complete the interaction successfully and change the address, but damned if I was able to figure it out. And this is, as the title says, every day in the life of a customer service representative. It’d be funnier if it didn’t suddenly and sharply display that, unfailingly, at some point in our lives we have all been Billy Swarth. At some point, we have let impatience or ignorance ruin someone’s day, and that person has had no choice but to suffer while smiling. I Get This Call Every Day is a fairly succinct statement on the matter--the only real flaw in the experience being the unskippable credits sequence putting a 2-minute gap between you and another playthrough--and yet, in a just world, the empathy afforded by sitting in service for any period of time should stick with the player for years. As mind-numbing and soul-draining as the game (and customer service in general) tend to be, any game whose ultimate lesson turns out to be, just maybe, be better to each other, is an experience worth having.  ","I Get This Call Every Day is a game that portrays the lightly filtered experience from the creator's day job in a customer service call centre, made interactive in a point & click format.",5.2
55,Heidi Kemps,Teen,8,7th Dragon III Code: VFD,"Jul 12, 2016"," Is there any creature in fiction more emblematic than the dragon? Their presence represents power, chaos, and struggle, no matter which side of the conflict they’re on. The dragons in 7th Dragon III: Code VFD are no different: their coming is heralded by the appearance of a mysterious orange flower, and when they emerge, all other lifeforms cower in fear at their tremendous power--so tremendous that their capacity for destruction transcends time itself. But where there is chaos, there is also hope…and heroes. Said heroes emerge in Tokyo in the year 2100. In this alternate history, dragon attacks devastated Earth in 2020. In the years that have passed, civilizations have been repaired, and people have cast aside their fear of the legendary destructive beasts. An enigmatic technology company called Nodens has created the hottest game of the new century, 7th Encount, a VR simulation designed to recreate the 80-year old tragedy. But when your group of gamers manages to conquer the VR world, you learn a horrible truth: the dragons have returned, and you’ve been chosen to take them on. In order to conquer these nightmare creatures, you’ll need to travel through time, discover the secrets of fantastic civilizations, and seek out a means to slay the 7th True Dragon. 7th Dragon III’s dungeons are presented from an overhead perspective, showcasing the game's beautiful environments filled with dazzling colors and stunning monuments--it's a shame the game doesn't support stereoscopic 3D. As you tread through dungeons, keeping an eye on the random encounter radar, your central obstacle will be the dragons: tough creatures that roam dungeons and can potentially invade other, weaker encounters. You can take on various sidequests while dungeon romping for rewards--and you’ll need every bit of help you can get to conquer the True Dragons that lurk at the end of the game’s chapters. Character classes function in new and interesting ways that are unlike any other game out there. For example, the God Hand is a class that offers a lot of strong healing techniques--but they are also capable to doing some of the highest damage in the game if you can land a particular sequence of martial-arts blows across several turns. The Hacker, meanwhile, hides from attacks while hacking into enemies’ brains to control them and give them vulnerabilities to other attacks--which the card-wielding Duelist and the status-ailment-consuming Fortuner can piggyback off of. There are a lot of potential team combinations across 7th Dragon III’s eight classes, though half of them don’t unlock until a later point in the game. Usually, this is a bit of a bummer in games like these--when you’ve got a good team dynamic going, it can be a pain to bring in a new class and learn their intricacies, especially if they start at level 1. Fortunately, once you’re into the meat of the game, you get the option to make a backup team. Backup teams gain EXP and skill points alongside your main team, making it easy to get them up to speed. They also play a valuable role in fights: backup members can charge up their skills every few turns, and once they’re ready, you can team up with them in a “buddy attack” that can break enemy buffs and bestow special skills. Once a certain amount of turns have passed, you can also command your whole backup team to give you a round of helpful buffs. And if you ever find your main team getting a bit worn down, you can always switch to a backup team between battles. On its default difficulty, 7th Dragon III has a very reasonable difficulty curve. It’s not an easy game by any means: mobs can wipe you out if you aren’t paying attention, status effects prove very punishing, and a dragon creeping into a random encounter might absolutely wreck you. But there are a lot of concessions to make the experience a more comfortable one: save points mid-dungeon, special Emergency healing skills you can use outside of battle, a more generous item capacity, and the ability to retry a battle if you wipe--saving you the anguish of lost progress. 7th Dragon III steers away from kicking you when you’re down, making it a skill-testing experience that manages to avoid being frustrating. There are plenty of fun little touches that lend 7th Dragon III its own unique character, as well. The futuristic setting with vibrant character art by manga artist Shirow Miwa stands out, as does the ambient techno soundtrack by famed game music composer Yuzo Koshiro. There are several memorable NPCs here: a nasty, foulmouthed boss bunny Nagamimi, a capricious company president Allie, and the charming but fierce rival to Team 13, Yuma. Killing dragons gives you points that you can use to upgrade Nodens HQ and unlock a ton of fun extras, like an in-game cat café (yes, really!). Most notable, however, are the character romances. You can build bonds between your created party members and/or certain NPCs--including same-gender relationships--and even go on dates where characters will give each other beneficial gifts. It’s a great element and a wonderful way to have fun with the characters you've created while earning special items along the way. There are a few annoyances, however: you can’t easily skip or fast-forward many cutscenes and battle animations, and it can be exhausting to watch the same combat scenes over and over during your quest. Some of the environments, while very pretty, are not particularly fun to navigate, with badly placed walls and needlessly long paths, which are tiresome even when you aren't being hounded by random encounters. And as good as some of the characters are, the base story is still standard fare: you’re not going to be surprised by much if you’ve been around the JRPG block a few times already. However, even with a couple of quibbles, it’s hard to deny the quality of 7th Dragon III taken as a whole. It’s challenging without being frustrating, unique in both its visual and character class design, and remains an engaging romp from chapter one to the finale.","7th Dragon III Code: VFD is a turn-based, dungeon-crawling RPG for the Nintendo 3DS.",10
56,Jason D'Aprile,Teen,5,Asemblance,"Jun 21, 2016"," From the interactive virtual art of Linger in Shadows to the more recent Everybody’s Gone to Rapture, there have been some touching narrative-focused games released in recent memory. Asemblance follows in Rapture's footsteps, creating an interactive short story for players to experience without concern for taxing challenges; observation is the key. Waking up to the sounds of a blaring alarm and an AI voice telling you there’s been an emergency, Asemblance shifts into a series of vignettes based on your character's memories. You’re a scientist trying to move through virtual reproductions of recorded events to discover the secret of a terrible trauma. It’s a great set-up for a game that skirts the lines between science fiction, horror, and relationship drama. Environments have a wistful, almost retro look, but the era isn't clearly defined: there are flat screen TVs, old computer monitors, rotary dial phones, and even a reel-to-reel tape recorder to be found. Given that you’re told by the omniscient AI that memories are inherently unreliable (and possibly outright false), this mix of technology adds to the moody, mysterious atmosphere. Likewise, the sound design mixes with shifting lights and colors that inspire distressing murmurs in the back of your mind. Unfortunately, any initial tension too quickly ends up in frustration and exasperation. Asemblance has huge narrative and flow problems. Finishing the game is a subjective concept--you can reach several different endings fairly easily and all of them are unsatisfying. It’s not the dark subject matter of love, loss, and regret that’s the problem. It’s how the game fails to tell its story in any coherent way. Much of the time in Asemblance is spent combing every inch of each location to find something to read, see, or interact with. Interacting is done in one of three ways--pressing the X button, using the R2 button to zoom in on something, or simply walking up to something. It’s vaguely reminiscent of old point-and-click-adventure games or hidden object games. After a while, you’ll be combing the same few areas over and over just to find something--anything--you might have missed to get the plot moving again. There are only a handful of events to witness and it becomes frustrating after a while to try uncovering something substantive. That’s unfortunate, because there are engaging, interesting, and even beautiful moments to behold. The sequence that feels ripped straight out of a Japanese horror film promises something dark and scary is coming. The forest path memory is a dreamy, wistful place with blooming flowers and fluttering butterflies. The use of jarring static to signify a glitch in the simulation is an effective trick as well. You don't feel connected to these memories as a result and instead feel like an interloper breaking into lives you know almost nothing about. Asemblance has the structure of a short, potentially fascinating interactive story, but the general lack of narration or direction doesn't work in its favor. For the most part, uncovering the events leading to the game’s present is done purely in the mind of the player. Zooming in on office desks to read memos, seeing a brochure in your apartment, or browsing intimate family photos. Outside of a few direct actions, the game seldom lets you know if anything you do is actually meaningful. You don't feel connected to these memories as a result and instead feel like an interloper breaking into lives you know almost nothing about. By the end of Asemblance, you're left with educated guesses based on hours of wandering through its few locations. Developer Nilo Studios says it wants this to be the start of a series of experiences reminiscent of the X-Files or the Twilight Zone. Unfortunately, there’s so little pay off in Asemblance that it’s difficult to muster much excitement for its future.",,5.7
57,Joab Gilroy,Mature,2,7 Days to Die,"Dec 13, 2013"," 7 Days to Die understands what games in the survival genre strive for. Dumped in an unforgiving world, you're tasked with living; first for a day, then seven days, and then for as long as possible. The hurdles to your survival are numerous, and the tasks required to overcome those hurdles can require complete knowledge of scavenging, crafting and item use. The core appeal of a survival game, as tedious as it may sound, sees players analyze, prioritize and capitalize on threats and opportunities which present themselves in the game world. So when you start 7 Days to Die on the morning of your first in-game day, you're told your top priority is to find wood, plant matter, small stones and more to create the basic items you need for survival. As you complete these tasks you find yourself kitted out with at least enough to get you through your first night--some clothes, a stone axe, a bow and some arrows--and then all guidance stops. You're left to your own devices; left to establish your own priorities via scavenging and exploration. This is the real 7 Days to Die experience. Exploration is difficult. The world is full of nasty things like zombies, bears and traps. Watching out for danger while also managing your priorities like food and water is tough enough already, but it's made tougher thanks to needing to navigate to the character menu to see your current food and water levels. The exploration is hindered further thanks to the game's terrible graphics. Low resolution textures across the board make the game look ugly. Repetitive use of assets turn landscapes into a monotonous ocean of similar looking trees, grass textures, and rocks until you reach a new biome. Worst of all is the heavy-handed use of fog, which reduces the view distance to a few dozen metres at most. This means enemies can very easily get the drop on you while you scavenge. Bird nests, which have precious feathers, are drab brown discs usually found on the similarly colored ground (not in trees), and many times while I hunted for them, zombies would catch me by surprise by exiting the fog after I'd already determined I was safe. The crafting system is menu-based, where you can craft almost any item provided you have the ingredients. Simply select the recipe, press up on the d-pad to build it and the game will (after some build time) create it for you. The exception here is that certain weapons require recipe manuals--if you want to make a rocket launcher, you'll need to find its recipe first. Scavenging is frustratingly difficult, as useful items are hard to come by. Instead you're forced to take what you can find--brass doorknobs, grain alcohol, rotten flesh--and do what you can to survive. When the seventh day hits you'll find out if you have everything you require or not, because a horde of zombies will flock across the map and do their best to murder you. If you haven't found the recipes you need, the ingredients required and completed the defensive work necessary, you'll find yourself outmatched against significant odds as the zombies can find you wherever you hide. On Xbox One, those odds really are nigh impossible. Disappointingly there's no aim-assist, which immediately increases the difficulty of the game compared to the PC version. Firing arrows at zombie heads requires pinpoint accuracy, an inherently more difficult task with a thumbstick without aim-assist. On top of that, instead of creating a menu system designed for a controller, the user interface simply uses the right thumbstick to control a slow-moving cursor. This is never more frustrating than when you find yourself in a town full of zombies and out of ammunition. Desperately trying to navigate your way through the menus to find the arrows recipe, then slowly moving your cursor across to the 'create all' indicator and waiting for an arrow to appear in your inventory is much harder and utterly maddening thanks to the terrible UI. 7 Days to Die looks significantly worse than its PC counterpart--even with the aforementioned fog and reduced view distance it struggles to run. Thanks to an auto-saving system the game will seize every minute or so. The loading times for saved games are abysmal, to the point that I was waiting more than 20 minutes for a game to load. Zombies regularly glitch and die standing instead of falling down dead, which isn't good when you dump another three of your last five arrows into it, still thinking they're a shambling threat. You can play online with people, but the game uses listen servers hosted by players, so all progress disappears if the host drops out. There's also little incentive to play with other people as, in most cases we experienced, hosts often quit if things go bad. 7 Days to Die on console is a terrible port of a game which otherwise shows real promise on PC, where it currently languishes in Early Access. In its current state on consoles, the game is technically playable, but that's the best that can be said of it.",Survive in this Zombie filled sandbox at all costs.,6.7
58,Scott Butterworth,Everyone,6,Song of the Deep,"Jul 12, 2016"," If Insomniac's Song of the Deep was a children's book or a graphic novel, I would have no problem singing its praises to anyone of any age. Its captivating portrayal of a young girl's undersea adventure not only looks and sounds beautiful, it also tells a story that sparkles with all the wonder, danger, and timelessness of a classic fable. But Song of the Deep is not a book. Rather, it's a relatively uninventive Metroidvania-style action-adventure title whose gameplay turns tedious and frustrating a little too often to forgive. If you're willing to weather the storm, however, Song of the Deep still delivers moments of fun and, more importantly, an entrancing, well-crafted story. The setup is simple and sweet: when her father fails to return from his latest fishing expedition, the young, resourceful Merryn cobbles together a ramshackle submarine and goes looking for him. Beneath the waves, she finds a spellbinding world full of sunken ships, hidden treasure, hideous monsters, and mysterious cities. The colorful, imaginative backdrops play perfectly on the pirate tales we loved as kids, evoking a sense of wonder that anyone can connect with. The music too is subtle but evocative, shifting from awe and tranquility to danger and dread as the tension starts to mount. The story itself is well-written. Like a Pixar film, it never condescends to its audience with watered-down exposition or moronic humor. Instead, it carefully and clearly builds a world, expertly introducing important elements early before bringing them back just in time to save the day later on. As you play, you'll receive little bursts of narration that feel like you flipped the page of a storybook. These moments are not only smartly paced, they also offer context and insight without simply explaining what's happening like some distant radio partner dumping exposition in your ear. Ultimately, Song of the Deep provides a rare and welcome example of exceptional interactive storytelling. Unfortunately, the game's mechanics don't deserve quite that much praise. You'll spend most of your time exploring the 2D world in Merryn's sub with only limited direction, carefully maneuvering through treacherous areas while gradually gathering upgrades. Once bolted on, these upgrades allow her to smash different types of barriers and enter previously inaccessible areas--you know, classic Metroidvania stuff. For the most part, exploration proves enjoyable, but the puzzles you encounter along the way--especially those that reward you optional upgrades and currency--tend to sink the experience. Most have an obvious solution but still require a great deal of patience to complete. You might need to, say, grab a sea mine with Merryn's finicky tethered claw and use it to explode a reinforced door. One glance at the scenario and you know, ""Okay: mine, door--got it,"" but dragging the uncooperative mine to that door without bumping something and prematurely detonating the device might make you pull your hair out. And that's just one example. Several repeated puzzle types are frustratingly time-consuming or worse, boring. You'll inevitably spend tons of time waiting: waiting for the searchlight to pass, waiting for the mine to respawn, waiting for your boost to recharge, waiting for an ocean current to stop. Later puzzles involving reflected beams of light can be even more infuriating simply because they're so damn protracted. In fairness, the puzzles do grow more inventive once you acquire later upgrades. Being able to float a bomb by blasting it with ice or flip a switch through a wall using a sonar pulse, for example, opens up some creative possibilities. I even uncovered a couple delightful ""A-ha!"" moments, like tricking a school of fish into eating the kelp encasing a chest. In between puzzles, there's always a chance you'll be attacked by some especially nefarious sea life. Thankfully, Song of the Deep comes prepared with simplistic but generally enjoyable combat mechanics. Though you can defeat enemies by smashing them with Merryn's claw or shooting them with various types of missiles, the controls utilize only a single stick, meaning you must always move and aim in the same direction. This isn't necessarily a problem, but it does underscore the simplistic nature of the mechanics. You can dodge attacks and repel enemies with your sonar once you find the requisite upgrades, and darting around blasting loads of deadly jellyfish does feel empowering. But the generous health and energy levels usually allow you to just pummel your attackers without much need for deeper strategy. Even ""boss battles"" mainly recycle the same basic, repetitive enemies. The only real challenge comes from eluding the invincible death squids that populate a specific part of the world. Being repeatedly one-hit killed and forced to restart from a distant spawn point is the scientific opposite of fun. Still, Song of the Deep's mix of combat, puzzle-solving, and exploration generally lands somewhere around ""fine,"" even if it waivers between aggravating and enjoyable in the process. And although the game tests your patience more often than your skill, its engrossing world and excellent story keep the experience afloat through it all.",,6
59,Peter Brown,Mature,8,Furi,"Jul 5, 2016"," When I first set my eyes on the stylish boss battle game Furi, I was sold by its striking presentation and excited about its mix of shoot-'em-up action and swordplay. It pits you against just under a dozen bosses, most of whom are relentless, strong, and fast. They don't just have one health bar; they have multiple, each one representing a new, and more challenging phase of combat. Their designs are the work of Afro Samurai artist Takashi Okazaki, and each is distinct and challenging in their own way; you won't soon forget their faces, let alone their fiendish fighting styles. Armed with an energy pistol, a sword, and the ability to dash, you have to fight bosses that turn invisible, bosses that automatically generate protective barriers, and bosses that emit dense and chaotic waves of bullets. Most stages are small circular arenas, but there are other locations that bend the rules, introducing a web of platforms or shifting to a 2D plane. Every battle is heightened by a thumping, energizing song from artists like Carpenter Brut and Danger, whose electric compositions are second-to-none, providing the perfect accompaniment whether you're on the brink of victory or the verge of defeat. Music aside, few battle stages are memorable, but the landscapes you trot across between battles leave an unmistakable impression. They are barren, weird, and coated in neon, presented through dramatic and occasionally unsettling camera angles. Furi is a beautiful game, one-upping its visuals from one scene to the next, but there are times when your surreal hikes overstay their welcome and you thirst for combat breeds temporary impatience; eye-catching cutscenes can't match the thrill of combat. Battles typically encompass two phases of fighting: free-roaming in an arena, and close-quarters within a small, circular boundary. While free-roaming, you play Furi like a twin stick shooter, where the direction of movement is independent from the trajectory of your gun's projectiles. Though your gun allows you to attack enemies from afar, they are only vulnerable at certain times, often in the middle of an action that ultimately produces an attack you have to avoid, or if you're quick with your sword, deflect back. So you fire your gun and dance out of harm's way, but when a boss rushes up for a melee attack, you have two options: dash away, or try to parry their attack. Dash, and you may be safe, but you are doing yourself a disservice. To succeed at Furi is to master the art of parrying, and anything less will almost certainly guarantee failure in later stages. Despite being difficult, Furi gives you all the tools you need to succeed from the very beginning, and while the odds are in favor of your opponents, it's the point. They don't call them bosses for nothing. Before an enemy issues a parryable attack, they will flash for an instant. Logic tells you that you should press the parry button during the flash, but in practice, the timing feels somewhat loose. ""No one said this was supposed to be fair,"" said one of my nemeses. She was right, and there were times that I felt Furi was unfair; times when I needed an excuse for failure. When you make it to the final phase of a 20-minute fight and die due to a small number of mistakes, it's easy to lose your cool having lost so much progress. Despite being difficult, Furi gives you all the tools you need to succeed from the very beginning, and while the odds are in favor of your opponents, it's the point. They don't call them bosses for nothing. Though the pace and rhythm of each boss' melee attacks change, when you establish a subconscious alignment with Furi's timing, you feel at home in combat. Without that skill, success is nigh impossible. To enjoy Furi is to understand its unspoken rules, a process that may involve repeated failure, and in turn, frustration, however: once you attain the ability to deflect attacks and punish your opponent with confidence, any feelings that Furi's bosses are unfair disappear. Upon completing the game, a bumpy process that took almost 10 hours, I felt accomplished, but I didn't feel like my work was finished; I couldn't help but start over. I had improved, both in terms of skill and knowledge. I knew how each boss behaved, and how to counter their most punishing attacks. My second time through the game, I had the advantage, and with my newfound confidence, I was an efficient killer, not desperate prey, and I beat the game in just over two hours without dying. Despite having seen it all before, Furi transformed as I had transformed, and what was once ""too difficult"" felt just right. Furi will make you sweat under pressure, scream in frustration, but it will also give you the drive to get better; to become a boss of your own. Furi lures you in with a cool lead character and a powerful soundtrack--qualities that are easy to appreciate--but its the journey to become a better fighter that defines the experience. Its disparate components are potent and leave an unforgettable impression that you won't soon forget. Furi will make you sweat under pressure, scream in frustration, but it will also give you the drive to get better; to become a boss of your own. Once you do, there's almost no feeling like it.","Furi is all about the tension of one-on-one fights against deadly adversaries. It’s an intense, ultra-responsive game with a unique mix of fast-paced sword fighting and dual-stick shooting.",7.2
60,Don Saas,,3,Breached,"Jun 22, 2016"," Cranes and excavators tower over a deserted alien landscape like skyscrapers. Mysterious obelisks and arches dot the horizon. Metallic colossi sprout out of the earth, decaying remnants of a dead world. Sentinels of pure electromagnetic energy roam the desert. Breached is a hybrid science fiction adventure game grounded in the legacy of Russian existentialist literature, particularly Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris and Stalker. You wake up in a damaged pod, suffering disorientation after a stint in long term hibernation. All you know for certain: your shelter is falling apart, your oxygen tank is low, and you've got eight days to come up with a survival strategy. Across the game's three large maps, your mission is to guide a drone to locate materials for repairing your ship and synthesizing fuel. As with all the game's controls, you pilot your drone using mouse clicks. Unfortunately, you're either flying at unnecessarily high speeds or standing still. That's helpful when you're zooming across an expansive desert and you only need to maneuver around the alien obelisks and construction equipment that dot the landscape. It's frustrating when, for the third time in 20 minutes as you are forced to navigate tiny cliffsides to reach caches, you fly off a cliff that houses the capsule you need to win the game. It's even worse when you need to carefully avoid the game's electromagnetic anomalies. If the drone touches an anomaly, your turn is over. Your turns are very limited over an in-game week, so if you lose more than one drone, it's essentially guaranteed that you'll lose the game. Exploring Breached's large maps for resources can be equally agonizing. There's a radar system that lets you know how close you are to the nearest resource, but there's no way to tune that radar to any of the specific materials you need to collect. Without that guidance, you spend a lot of time wandering aimlessly, praying to find what you need. Given that you need a lot of fuel and many parts to repair your ship, this becomes yet another tiresome act that weighs Breached down. The story is presented via text logs that your character reads from their computer inside of their pod. Like the game's evocative alien landscapes, these logs hold a hint of promise. Sadly, they ultimately devolve into a banal technobabble. The game is a very basic text adventure during these portions. You click on a handful of hyperlinks in the text logs, and based on which hyperlinks you click, the details you're given into Breached's lore change. You can also do a little detective work by clicking on hashtags at the end of the text logs that give you more logs to read and more pieces of the story to put together. On the surface, the story has some interesting pieces. Is everything really what it appears? Are you actually stranded and about to die, or is the game some bizarre virtual reality experiment gone wrong? There are hints of cataclysms and factions at work and even teases that you've done this before as your memories return. But these are just breadcrumbs that whet your appetite for something more substantive that never arrives. There's a case to be made (see: Journey, Limbo or The Witness) for games that tease lore and worldbuilding without giving concrete answers, but Breached lacks the imagination and stylistic flair needed to fully draw you into its ambiguous tale. But it's the game's resource management that ends up being the biggest source of frustration. You have eight days to gather the resources you need, and the larger macro-actions you take use up a certain percentage of your energy for that day. If you go exploring, you immediately lose 40% of your energy, which makes any failed expedition practically fatal for the long-term run of a game. If you want to open one of the capsules you find--whose contents are randomized each playthrough--that's 30% of your energy. There are four different components the capsules can give you, and the game changes how much you need of each to repair your ship each time you restart the game. So, even if after multiple playthroughs you manage to memorize the location of enough capsules to repair your shelter, it won't matter because their contents are liable to change. But all of that pales in comparison to the madness of synthesizing fuel. There are three main sources of fuel in the game: alpha, beta, and gamma material. The game's conceit is that your material analyzer is broken so you have to manually synthesize those materials into fuel. In order to synthesize fuel, you need to combine specific proportions of all three materials, and those portions are different each time. The game gives you no clue what the solution is, and there are enough potential solutions that it's perfectly feasible you never solve the problem. In three complete playthroughs (and a handful of half-playthroughs that I quit in rage), I managed to guess the correct solution once. If you want any hope of succeeding, you'll need to play through Breached multiple times. But the exploration and text-driven portions of the game are totally static, and resource management is so maddeningly random that victory becomes a far from certain affair. Considering how poorly it controls, how shallow its mystery proves to be, and how little Breached cares if you succeed, it's pretty easy to mark it as a sci-fi adventure worth skipping. Breached has a spark, but it ultimately fades before catching fire.  ",,3.7
61,Justin Haywald,Teen,8,Monster Hunter Generations,"Jul 15, 2016"," Monster Hunter Generations can be a tough game to love. It isn't going to treat you nice--if you're having trouble with a battle, no hint screen pops up pointing out the obvious tells you may have missed. The creatures have no large, glowing ""hit me here"" emblems like in most other action-adventure games. You learn--sometimes through repetition, often through failure--how to deftly use your weapons. You have to watch your prey carefully, plan out an attack, and when the beast starts to limp, then you go in for the kill. When you fail, it's almost always because you were too greedy, you rushed headlong into battle instead of being patient, biding your time. This is the flow that Monster Hunter Generations captures so perfectly, and which lies at the heart of why Monster Hunter is such a consistently well-regarded series. Last year's Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate added a couple of new weapons, as well as the ability to attack from above and mount your prey. Monster Hunter Generations retains 4 Ultimate's additions and takes them even further with new Hunting Styles and Hunter Arts. For a newcomer who might just be getting their head around which weapon they should use, there's an intimidating amount of new info at the outset of the game, but the Hunter Arts in particular open up combos and attack possibilities that make playing the game easier than ever before. Doling out damage in combat builds up various Hunter Arts meters that have a wide range of helpful effects, from an automatic combo that deals major damage to a stamina boost that can help you escape dangerous situations. The new Hunting Styles determine how many of those Hunting Arts you're able to equip and also affect the combos you're able to pull off. The Guild Style is the closest to the standard Monster Hunter experience for people who don't like change. The Aerial Style lets you jump, making the relatively new mounting mechanic even easier to pull off. Striker Style sacrifices some combos in order to use more Hunter Arts. And the Adept Style is an advanced setup that allows players who are able to dodge and guard with expert timing to hit for additional damage. The additions don't decrease the game's difficulty, but they do provide new ways to approach combat and allow even novices to wreak havoc on the battlefield. Unfortunately, the game does a terrible job of explaining how most things work, including the new Styles and Arts. Tutorials are text heavy affairs and even within tutorial missions, you're frequently told to consult your Hunter's Notes (basically an in-game manual) for more information. To get an education on how to play Monster Hunter at the skill level required to tackle the game's tougher beasts requires finding an experienced friend or going to YouTube videos for practical advice. But a great way to jump into the game for newcomers, and to breath new life into the experience for veterans, is by playing as the cat-like Prowler. The game's feline companions have become more and more involved with the main game over the years, but in Generations, you can actively take on the role of a cat you recruit. The rules for cats are different from the regular hunters'. You can't use items--instead, cats are able to perform actions like fishing and mining without wasting any consumables. You have nine lives, giving you a few more opportunities to fail during a fight. And the cats have a whole slew of different abilities that they can learn by leveling up. The Prowlers aren't quite as hardy as the main hunter, but the focus on faster action, being able to gather resources without using items, and their unique combat abilities make them a great way to change up both the single- and multiplayer campaigns. Gameplay-wise, the Prowlers are fairly self-explanatory, but the customization, abilities, and leveling system is very different and much more complicated than the standard hunter. Like with most things in Monster Hunter, either trial-and-error or online guides are a much better way to figure out how things work than wading through the frequently sparse in-game explanations. Otherwise, Generations hews closely to 4 Ultimate: the musical score is great and worth wearing headphones to fully appreciate. The excellent online multiplayer system, despite the lack of voice chat, provides stable connections whether you're online or in the same room as your friends. Generations even tries to make the game's primary systems easier to access. The multiplayer arena has a staging area with all of the amenities you'll find in town: tweak your character, upgrade your armor, fill up on a stat-boosting meal. The hunter area is so friendly that in some ways, it makes exploring the game's towns feel almost unnecessary. Each town is full of visual personality and offers new quests to collect from the townsfolk, but those quests could just as easily be collected elsewhere. Admittedly, it would be annoying to constantly check the stock of each town individually for new items or needlessly go back and forth between towns to get to the actual game of hunting. But, outside of the nostalgia elicited by character cameos from previous Monster Hunter games, you're not given any compelling reason to explore or visit the different locations. It's easier to hang out in the main hub since that's where you have to go to group up with other people anyway. But spending any amount of time there highlights Generations’ bigger issue: there's no good reason the game should separate its single-player and multiplayer content. Calling them that is a bit misleading. To clarify, the main game, with separate towns and NPCs, is only available offline and as a single-player experience. The mostly nonexistent story about powerful monsters sits far on the periphery of the game. But the Hub area, where you can group up with other players or take on challenges on your own, offers up the mostly the same quests with mostly the same rewards but minus the story. Essentially, to get the full game experience, you have to play through almost every quest twice, but you can only increase your publicly displayed Hunter Rank by playing in the Hub. The same problem existed in 4 Ultimate, but that game got away with it to a degree by giving you an evolving town and a more cohesive narrative to explore in single-player. In Generations, there isn't enough of a divide between playing with friends and playing on your own to make the separation feel like anything more than artificial padding. But none of Monster Hunter weaknesses are able to drag down the core experience. That artificial padding forces you to fight the same monsters over and over again, but that's something you'll want to do anyway to complete the best sets of armor and just better at the game. Monster Hunter Generations' tutorials are obtuse, and you can only learn where to find some rare items by dumb luck or by looking them up in a guide. But the combat system still offers the same deep rewards it always has. Monster Hunter Generations still feels like a niche, punishing game that bears more in common with Dark Souls than an adventure game you'd typically find on 3DS. But that punishment never feels arbitrary. After dozens of hours I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of this adventure--there are other weapons and Hunter Art combinations I want to try, and of course, there are many more monsters to hunt. With Monster Hunter you get out what you put into the game, and Monster Hunter Generations is a game that compels me to put in more of my time.

62,Miguel Concepcion,Everyone 10+,7,Pokemon GO,"Jul 7, 2016"," It's fitting that Pokemon’s most significant evolutionary leap in its 20-year history is on a mobile platform, which mirrors its humble origins on the Game Boy. We’re going outside with Pokemon Go, catching Pokemon with friends, fighting over gyms, and making new friends along the way. Much of Pokemon Go's augmented reality infrastructure was already in place thanks to developer Niantic’s location-based MMO mobile game, Ingress. Both games feature point-of-interest check-ins and territorial conflicts, except that Go features three teams compared to Ingress’ two, designated conflict zones are now gyms, and landmarks are called Pokestops. Assuming you’re in a densely populated area, you won’t have a problem growing your collection as there are Pokemon everywhere. The act of capturing these critters follows the single-thumb input of many popular mobile games. Simulating a throwing motion, a forward swipe toward your target (with a bit of finesse for specific distances) is all it takes to trap basic Pokemon. It’s a credit to the diverse behaviors of these wild beasts that you can’t lackadaisically throw Pokeballs as you attempt to capture them--you have to factor whether the Pokemon can fly, jump, or deflect incoming Pokeballs. These pocket monsters litter the landscape often in accordance to their terrain. It’s not unheard of to come across a water-type Goldeen around a town square but they’re more abundant around large bodies of water. The simple act of leaving your familiar dwellings will open yourself to a wider, more diverse net of potential captures. This, along with the high gym count in cities, underscores the disadvantages of rural players, many of whom have relatively limited access to rare Pokemon. It is through rampant collecting that Go showcases much of its depth, especially to Pokemon novices. The chances of capturing the same monster with the exact same stats are astronomically low, which makes capturing multiples of the same Pokemon a sound tactic. This, along with the initial storage limit of 250 Pokemon, spurs you to make judgement calls on which ones to keep and which ones to recycle. Reminiscent of collectable card games, battling in a gym is a duel of stats and hoping your cumulative abilities outweigh your opponent’s. Health, weight, height, moveset, and type are all factors that go into a gym fight. The most crucial variable is a Pokemon's CP, which can be upgraded using candy and stardust, two currencies that you earn with each capture. There’s a satisfying sense of trainer ownership when planning a gym battle, to curate a squad and to carefully curate an order in which your Pokemon will fight. Pokemon Go stays true to the franchise’s strategic appeal, even if it doesn’t offer the conveniences of turn-based battles. There’s added depth in the actual battle, which plays out in real time. Careful timing is needed when attacking (screen tapping) and dodging (screen swipes), and your stats determine the effectiveness of your offensive moves as well your capacity to take hits. What makes these duels even more involved is the ability to gang up on a gym team with multiple concurrent battles. The opportunities to participate and excel in a group help lower the barrier to entry for latecomers. This is partly because the takeover of a gym is not determined by a single fight, but rather a series of encounters that could potentially wear down the gym owner over time. It’s a blessing that gym battles can be a collaborative effort since Pokemon Go offers little instruction on how to be victorious in these virtual face offs. The nuances and timing of attacks and dodges are learned through trial and error and sharing experiences with players in public. You won't learn advanced controls and tactics in the game like adding spin your Poke Ball to making special throws. It’s not ideal, but at least there is gratification in socializing with other players to figure out the game's esoteric mechanics. The sharing of notes, group capture sessions, and bonding through team battles are Pokemon Go’s social strengths and help fans ignore the current absence of a key series component: trading. While some form of trading is planned, it’s unfortunate that a feature synonymous with the series was not present at launch. One crucial design benefit of Pokemon Go is that its social draw isn’t limited to adversarial team battles. Collecting can be a communal effort because no one wild Pokemon is exclusive to the first person who captures it. Once a 60 kilogram Charmander with 260 CP shows up at the Starbucks on 4th and Main Street in San Francisco, every player has a fair opportunity to capture it. This experience can be greatly enhanced with lures, consumable items that attract more Pokemon to a set location. More Pokemon begets more people which can lead to new friendships. Beyond the bland map art and the limited trainer character design options is a lively world of animated icons for gyms and Pokestops. Niantic wisely focused their efforts here on the Pokemon themselves, particularly their dramatic and flashy evolution sequences. During capture events, they counter your Poke Ball throws with dodges and blocks, while they’re even livelier during gym battles. It’s also not uncommon to approach a gym that is currently in the midst of a power struggle, indicated by the amusing Looney Tunes-inspired whirlwind animation. When you join the fight, it truly feels like a team effort to see your buddy’s Pokemon battling at the far side of the arena. It’s too early to tell if Pokemon Go will be make a meaningful impact on the cardiovascular health of its users, but developer Niantic has the right idea in repurposing key elements of the franchise to suit real life exploration and movement. Much like in the mainline series, egg fertilization in Go relies on walking, running, or biking specific distances, whether that’s two kilometers or 10. This incubation process isn’t perfect. You can cheat in a car by driving slowly and since the game tracks your movements via GPS, running on a treadmill will not count. Pokemon Go’s strengths can’t hide the fact that its initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels, from server and potential security issues to invisible trainers. Crashes can come during monster captures, GPS reconnections, and even when you’re taking a screenshot. One particularly upsetting issue is a bug that makes gym opponents invincible, which is especially unfair if you’ve exhausted your best Pokemon during this battle. These issues occur often enough to cause immense frustration but not enough to warrant giving up altogether. Compounding these issues is Go’s high battery consumption. Even with the AR camera turned off and power saving option turned on, it’s still possible to fully drain a year-old Samsung Galaxy S6 in less than two hours. Expect to invest in an external battery if you don’t own one already. Speaking of spending money, the in-game shop offers a collection of optional items, though they may only be valuable to truly ambitious players. Much of the gear can be acquired through general play, by leveling up, and checking in at landmarks. In classic free-to-play fashion, the majority of the shop items merely accelerate the monster collecting process, whether you’re using lures and incense to attract Pokemon or cracking lucky eggs for a temporary experience bonus. If Pokemon Go’s initial public reception is anything to go by, its ability to draw players from multiple generations and varied gaming backgrounds together is a game worthy of attention. When it works, Pokemon Go feels like a natural evolution for the series, very much a product of the times without making the mainline series obsolete. Its bugs and high battery consumption do not outweigh the old-but-new thrill of capturing Pikachu at a local park or vanquishing a Snorlax while conquering a gym.

63,Jason D'Aprile,Everyone,8,Videoball,"Jul 12, 2016"," Rocket League seemingly came out of nowhere last year and hooked players with its simple, but absurdly fun mechanics. Videoball is, in many ways, this year’s equivalent. It’s far more low-tech than Rocket League, but maintains that engaging sense of quirky fun. Videoball will create a warm and fuzzy sense of nostalgia, in its mechanics, but also aesthetics. If you’ve been around the gaming block awhile--especially since the late '90s--Videoball will immediately create a warm and fuzzy sense of nostalgia. The title screen, menus, the commentator voices, the music…everything about the look, sound, and feel of the game smacks of love for Sega’s heyday. Videoball is a very simple game. A ball spawns in the center of the field and two teams of arrows fight to shoot the ball into their opponent’s goal. The players are literal arrow points, either red or blue. The ball is just a circle and the field is mostly a mix of squares and rectangles--it looks primitive, yet clean and concise. Gameplay is inspired by a variety of sports--football and soccer chiefly among them--but it's easy to control, with only one button to worry about. You take a basic shot with the ball in your possession with a quick tap, but by holding the button down to charge shots, there's room for more strategic play. When charging, you can opt for a lighter-than-normal shot, or release it when the charge is full to fire the equivalent of a speeding bullet. Overcharge your shot, and your arrow creates a block, which is, as one might guess, good for blocking things. On boards with smaller goal areas, the block can temporarily prevent the opposing team from scoring. Other times, it just makes the path to a goal less direct. Videoball relies heavily on things bouncing off each other for its entertainment value. Hitting the ball directly with your arrow, for instance, shoves you back and stuns you for a second. Bouncing the ball off obstacles enables terrific bank shots. Hitting another player with a charged shot will result in a careening tackle, briefly taking them out of the action before they regain control again. Videoball's simple controls and straightforward presentation make for a great multiplayer game that nearly anyone can just sit down and have fun with. Matches range from one-on-one to three-on-three and support a variety of options that work for online or local play--the entire match takes place on a single screen, so you won't have to worry about dealing with a split-screen view. There aren’t different game modes so much as a huge variety of game fields with different layouts that call for complex tactical thinking, cespite the initially simple mechanics. The basic open field gives way to obstacle-laden maps with smaller goals that require greater understanding of the bounce physics and charge-level of your shots. For the times when you want to play alone, though, Videoball's arcade mode has you covered, though it can't match the excitement of a live match with friends. Each level sports a different AI player that uses very specific tactics. While one level might use AI players that focus heavily on defense, the next match might pit you against quirky arrows that are out to get your arrow directly and barely care about the ball. The AI isn’t terribly sophisticated--and they frequently ignore balls on your end of the field--but it’s a varied approach to handling single-player in a primarily multiplayer game. You can also use AI players in multiplayer games to enable human vs bot matches. With its distinctively clean retro stylings and deceptively simple set up, Videoball may blindside you with the pace and depth of its gameplay. It's reminiscent of arcade classics, and is easily one of the best multiplayer experiences of the year. It bridges the gap between the hardcore shooter-loving players and those interested in sports who want something different. It may be low-tech, but Videoball's simple elegance deserves high marks.

64,Jason D'Aprile,Mature,6,The Technomancer,"Jun 28, 2016"," The studio Spiders has long been to Bioware what the SyFy Channel is to Hollywood: it takes a popular big-budget concept and creates an eager but far less grandiose adaptation. All of this remains true of its latest game, The Technomancer. It could be seen as a kind of prequel to an earlier Spiders game, Mars: War Logs. The Technomancer takes place on a colonized Mars, where corporations vie for control against a seedy, crime-filled background. Players take the role of one particular Technomancer--an elite agent with magic-like electricity-based powers--on a quest to discover the secrets of a grand conspiracy. The game is more Total Recall than Mass Effect, but is clearly inspired by Bioware RPGs and CD Projekt Red's Witcher games. There is a lot to do in The Technomancer. There’s an in-depth crafting system wherein you can create new weapons, armor, and items, and then create modifications for each item to increase their power and usefulness. There are multiple fighting styles, each with its own skill tree, which allow for a wide selection of combat strategies. There’s a morality system, lots of missions, and an large variety of locations to explore. Indeed, everything--on paper, at least--points to an expansive, if not terribly original Western role-playing experience. There's a lot of activities at your fingertips, but options alone can't save The Technomancer. The problem is simple: the game does a lot of things all at once, just none of them particularly well. Combat allows for a lot of variety, but pacing is haphazard. You have the option to switch between a staff, shield, and single-handed weapon, or the rogue-based dagger and gun. You can also unleash brilliant blue electrical hell on opponents. Unfortunately, in a game where fighting off multiple opponents at once is the norm, combat just never feels smooth or intuitive. Controls are jerky with almost no subtlety of motion, and overstepping targets happens far too often, leading to missed attacks and frustration. The concept of simply “knocking” enemies out after bashing, stabbing, and electrifying them is especially out of whack. Unlike Spiders’ previous game, Bound by Flame, you can only play as a single male character. The game allows you to customize his look, but it feels like a cheap omission to not allow more variety in how you shape your Technomancer. Though you aren't technically alone on Mars you might as well be. Enemy AI is barebones, exhibiting some decent pathfinding, but enemies mostly just stand around mindlessly attacking. Sadly, ally AI is even worse. They seldom manage to take an enemy down on their own, even when given better gear. At best, they are useful for briefly distracting opponents when you get mobbed, but even then, it’s hit-and-miss. Likewise, the game's presentation is all over the place. Some of the creature bosses look terrific. There are occasional impressive vistas and other sights to see, but close-ups of characters are strangely creepy and reminiscent of pre-Skyrim Elder Scrolls games. Dialogue and voice acting are frequently awkward, characters are generally stiff in both appearance and behavior, and the morality system really comes down to whether you choose to outright kill defeated (human) opponents or knock them out; nobody bats an eye when you kill creatures and suck up their essence--which acts as a form of currency on Mars. There’s a lot to nitpick about in The Technomancer, but the game also fills a specific niche. This is the B-list version of a big budget RPG. It’s almost inspiring how plucky Spiders is in its execution of The Technomancer. It's clearly trying to emulate the range of worlds and playstyles of games like The Witcher 3 and Dragon Age in a sci-fi setting, but isn't quite up to the task. It’s buggy, flawed, and, frankly, kind of cheap. This is absolutely a SyFy Channel-grade RPG, with all that implies. Is the Technomancer a good game? Maybe not, but it still manages to have a decided measure of charm anyway.

65,Jason D'Aprile,Everyone 10+,3,Ghostbusters,"Jul 12, 2016"," It’s not surprising that Activision has chosen to release a Ghostbusters game right in time for the movie reboot or that it’s a four-player cooperative twin-stick shooter. Really, the only thing truly surprising about the game is how clueless it seems to be about its own genre and license. Ghostbusters is a nearly full-priced release that feels more like a budget bomb. To put that in context, I actually like the last-gen Ghostbusters games, including the similarly themed four-way, very arcade-like, Sanctum of Slime. It's slight and disposable, but it nailed the old-school multiplayer groove. It wasn’t a particularly good game, but it was far and away better than this one. This new Ghostbusters has none of the redeeming qualities of its predecessor. This romp takes place after the events of the new movie. You don’t play any of the that film's Ghostbusters though, instead taking the role of a squad of rookies (just as in the previous game). They’re a bit more diverse than usual, at least--two women and two men fill the team--but they’re standard archetypes for a multiplayer twin-stick shooter: the big guy is a mini-gun carrying tank, while his buddy is the assault rifle-carrying smart guy. The two ladies offer up proton pack versions of a shotgun and dual pistols. With a full compliment of human players at the controls, they make a fairly well-rounded team, even if their personalities fail to make a meaningful impression. The game takes you all over New York City and, eventually, beyond. There are treks through a graveyard, cruise ship, hotel, and other haunted locales across 10 stages. Each level plays out the same way: you fight a bunch of the same, smaller ghost baddies, then some larger ones who require switching to the traditional proton beam to weaken them further so you can trap them, and eventually a pattern-based boss ghost. This formula is serviceable at first, but it doesn't take long before you start to feel like you're merely going through the motions, completing uninspiring chores. You can also switch to the P.K.E. meter during non-combative moments to find secret goodies hidden throughout the level. This dual set-up is the standard boilerplate twin-stick shooter template, which isn’t necessarily a terrible thing. The problem here is that Ghostbusters somehow manages to suck the life out of both its own license and gameplay. To be more specific, Ghostbusters is mind-numbingly boring. Levels are huge--too large for this kind of game--and filled mostly with empty space and confusing, seemingly random designs. Some levels can take over an hour, devoid of interesting environments or fun challenges--it's enough to put you to sleep. There are half-baked elements that might have improved things with better execution. The upgrade system lets you increase weapons and stats of each character, but the characters start out so ponderously slow that increasing their speed becomes a priority. Even after these upgrades, though, the controls are unresponsive, and shooting ghosts remains cloying. While each level tends to introduce a couple new enemies, there’s very little variety overall. You encounter the same larger mid-boss opponents ad nauseam as the drawn-out levels progress. Even with that sense of repetition, you spend most of your time aimlessly walking around more than actually battling spirits. There are huge arena-sized areas with virtually nothing in them. The P.K.E. meter may initially inspire you to search every corner of a level, but there’s little payoff when you do. And although Ghostbusters uses the Unreal 4 engine, its aesthetics don't redeem its poor accompanying factors. It’s trying hard to summon the cel-shaded animated look of Borderlands, but isn’t up to the task. The mundane looking ghosts are uninspired and landscapes are basic. The soundtrack, however, evokes the proper nostalgia, making it one of the only standout qualities in an otherwise substandard game. The overall score is surprisingly dramatic, making it much better than any other aspect of the game. In the end, Ghostbusters has rare moments when it doesn't feel like an utter waste of time. But it's mostly a bizarre slog through mostly empty, overly cumbersome levels full of extreme repetition. Even for devoted fans of the films and four-player co-op shooters, Ghostbusters is a disappointment.  ","Have you and your friends been experiencing paranormal activity?

66,Daniel Starkey,,7,Brigador,"Oct 16, 2015"," A grimey, lo-fi text-to-speech program coughs out a made-up word: ""Brig-a-dor."" From here on, I know what I'm in for. Brigador isn't like today's games. From the moment you start playing you'll wrestle with befuddling menus and a nonsensical plot. But that's okay; menus don't hinder much in this case, and the plot is no more important here than it was in the original Doom. What matters in this game is satisfying action in a destructible playground with badass mechs. And there, Brigador delivers. The eponymous brigador are a series of mechs that range from nimble hovercraft to hulking tanks on legs, and each has a shield and a basic array of attacks. Bigger brigs can stomp the ground and fire colossal mortars, while nimble craft rely on light ordnance like machine guns. After running through a couple of tutorials that introduce you to the basic controls and abilities of each mech, you're dropped into your first mission--and it is a maelstrom. In seconds, you're swarmed by all manner of enemies ranging from unarmored men with guns all the way up to other brigs. The rush is overwhelming and forces you to think tactically. You may be outnumbered and outgunned, but if you can outthink your digital foes, you'll be fine. In this effort, terrain and movement are your biggest allies. During my first big firefight I found myself surrounded, but there was a shipping depot not too far away. I used my temporary cloak to dash through their ranks and break for cover behind shipping containers. I managed to funnel my attackers into one of two chokepoints, so I could focus my fire. Because these mechs are loosely based on real-world tanks, though, their armor is thickest in the front and weak on the sides and back. My tactic, while helpful, wasn't necessarily the best or only way to approach the scenario. Your enemies employ spotters, alarms, and plenty of automated defense systems that can hamper or even halt your progress towards a mission objective. If you carelessly run and gun, and don't have a monstrous, overpowered mech to match, you'll be crushed. The action is fast-paced, but you can't afford to be reckless. Brigador works in these little oscillations. It will present you with a chaotic, borderline unmanageable situation and then force you to figure out a plan. It can feel overwhelming at times, especially after the comparatively restrained tutorial areas, but you shouldn't have too hard a time as long as you play mindfully. To that end, Brigador gives you a lot of tools to help you control encounters. For example, every mech has a few weapons slots and a defensive technique. When you set out for a mission you can choose your loadout, including which chassis and armament you think will serve you best. Smoke grenades, cloaking and EMP grenades can disable or avoid enemies altogether. When combined with some terrain knowledge, you can use your machine to tear through a wall and attack a vital target before anyone sees you. Or you can set-up an ambush, tricking heavier tanks into revealing their rear for a swift and deadly assault. While it looks like a twin-stick shooter, Brigador is a lot more precise and demanding. You control the direction you're facing, where you're moving, and the firing arc of your weapons independent of one another. And Brigador keeps that flexibility throughout. While progression in terms of unlocking new parts or chassis is linear, the campaign and the flow of individual missions is left open. If one level is frustrating, you're free to skip it altogether. It all serves a weird power fantasy that runs throughout. Brigador wants to drop you into a quagmire and force you to adapt. Enemies will swarm and flank, and unless you've been particularly stealthy, you'll often have to deal with attacks from all sides. You need to manage all of this on top of every movement of your mech, trying not to expose its weakpoints while focusing on the most dangerous targets. It's a lot to process and manage, but when it all comes together, succeeding in the face of such complexity and chaos is very satisfying. In many ways, Brigador is the modern, indie progeny of classic mecha games like Armored Core. It's rough around the edges, and doesn't do much with its story or its tutorials, but distills the gluttony of the 90s action genre into an impassioned, indulgent package.","Brigador is an isometric vehicle action game set in completely destructible environments. Highly difficult without being unfair. Lush revivalist graphic style reminds you of what 90's games would look like now. Huge variety of playable vehicles and weapons, deep tactics and high skill ceiling with custom map support all contribute to a game built to be played and enjoyed for a long time.",10
67,Peter Brown,Everyone 10+,7,I Am Setsuna,"Jul 19, 2016"," There are times when I Am Setsuna's mimicry is too obvious for its own good, when you immediately recognize that it's a deliberate effort to trigger nostalgia for classic Japanese RPGs. But these moments don't tell the whole story. Poignant events and some delicate writing lend distinction to the otherwise archetypal cast, and you grow to appreciate how tenets of the genre are ignored in favor of trying something new. The juxtaposition of I Am Setsuna's numerous inventions and references make for an eye-opening examination of Japanese RPGs, and a satisfactory debut from developer Tokyo RPG Factory. In a world blanketed in snow and overridden with beasts, young Setsuna sets out to reach The Last Lands. It is there that she will fulfill her duty as a human sacrifice--a ritual held every decade to keep wild threats at bay. With the help of like-minded adventurers, you accompany Setsuna through caverns and forests, fending off creatures and thwarting--or recruiting--humans that try to stand in your way. Setsuna would be the first to admit that her fate is tragic, but she remains ever steadfast and resolute in her charge. You can say the same for her companions, some of whom face very different but equally somber realities with grace. I Am Setsuna expresses occasional jocularity through a corny joke or quippy NPC dialogue, but its story is dominated by hardship. Forget the perfunctory villains and other tangible obstacles that come up; it's the emotional baggage that your companions carry that's notable. There are secrets to keep, actions to regret, and bad luck to accept. Clocking in around 20 hours--moderately short by RPG standards, it's unfortunate that I Am Setsuna doesn't allow more time for backstory and character development, because there are a few moments that are begging for more attention. The majority of your adventure is steeped in combat, which is almost identical to Chrono Trigger's battle system and, thankfully, every bit as enjoyable. There are no random encounters in I Am Setsuna, and no enemies on the world map; battles begin when you bump into enemies visible in dungeons. When combat kicks off, enemies and your party members are arranged in starting positions. Different skills and attacks change your position on screen, although you never actually have control over movement – enemies are also in a constant state of motion. Positioning can be important when using certain skills or weapons that have areas of effect rather than single targets. Waiting for enemies to wander into an ideal arrangement can pay off, but it potentially comes with risks depending on which version of I Am Setsuna's turn-based combat you choose to play. Active mode allows each character's active time battle gauge to fill on a constant basis; when the ATB gauge is full, a character is able to act. Active mode brings the added challenge of time management, where you need to make a move quickly to avoid wasting time in menus--take too long and an enemy can potentially sneak in an extra turn. If you choose to play in Wait mode, all ATB gauges stop charging when you're picking an action from the command menu, affording you more time to plan your next move. Choosing between one or the other is an easy way to make the game more challenging or forgiving, but most common enemies rarely pose a threat. The only time you may desire to play in Wait mode is during some of the game's boss battles, where the difficulty abruptly spikes. Each character has an inherent strength, weapon type, and selection of skills, known as techs. Techs are a product of spritenite--magical stones slotted into talismans, I Am Setsuna's secondary equipment. Certain characters can combine techs in combat to dish out a devastating attack or a powerful recovery spell, so long as they both have full ATB gauges. With a limited number of slots, you have to carefully pick and choose which techs to carry. Doing so will help you form a well-rounded team, and ensure the availability of preferred combo attacks, which are tied to specific techs. When things are left to chance in an RPG, it can feel like all of the effort you put into planning and crafting your team loses some of its meaning. Every tech can be enhanced on-the-fly during combat when a character builds up enough Setsuna Points to trigger momentum--you earn SP when you attack, take damage, or hold your position with a full ATB gauge. Triggering Momentum bonuses requires you to press a button immediately after a flash of light that occurs just before a character takes an action. Managing your momentum opportunities is the most critical element during difficult fights, as it can effectively turn one action into two. You can occasionally trigger HP recovery after an attack, or spread an action that would typically impact one character to your entire party--or every enemy on screen. Momentum opportunities can mean the difference between a win or a loss, and seriously add to the tension of Active mode's already stressful time management. Triggering momentum during combat can also lead to singularities, seemingly random events that grant extreme benefits to your team. Despite the fact that you can influence the chance of singularities occurring, it's impossible to plan for them. They are, in effect, bonuses, but they are so overpowered that they can make a challenging battle feel like a walk in the park. It's refreshing to receive a helping-hand now and again, but some singularities limit your abilities in favor of boosting others--Chrono Burst makes your ATB gauge fill faster than usual, but it stops you from using combo moves, which isn't necessarily a welcome surprise. When things are left to chance in an RPG, it can feel like all of the effort you put into planning and crafting your team loses some of its meaning. In typical RPG fashion, characters earn experience from combat and level up, but rather than impact every stat, new levels only boost a character's HP and MP. In order to grow stronger and heartier, you have to seek out new weapons, which directly dictate a character's physical and magical strength, as well as both types of defense. Therefore, purchasing weapons becomes a habit the moment you discover a new town. But you can't buy anything in I Am Setsuna until you sell materials--objects earned in battle and found on the ground when exploring dungeons--because currency isn't doled out after fights or found in treasure chests. While this is a curious and unorthodox approach to dealing with in-game money, selling materials is needlessly laborious. When facing a list of dozens upon dozens of materials--some enemies can drop over ten different resources in a single battle--it would be great to have an option to sell everything at once. In practice, you have to go down the list, one by one, selling each type of material. In addition to earning you money, they end up in the hands of the merchants who sell spritenite, which becomes available for sale once you've traded in the appropriate items. I Am Setsuna walks in the footsteps of giants, and is thus dwarfed by the memories of games that inspired it. There's a lot to unpack when discussing combat and configuring your party, but it's not that complex in practice. You grow accustomed to managing your Momentum opportunities and configuring techs across your team. Again, some bosses pose a real threat, but by the end of the game, mobs of common enemies--even strong ones--can't stand up to a well-oiled party, and can be wiped with a single combo move and a little added Momentum. As such, it can feel like you're going through the motions when playing I Am Setsuna. This, paired with obvious references to well-known games, can make the game feel rote and at worst, boring. I Am Setsuna is an unapologetic homage to beloved Japanese RPGs that plays well but takes few risks. Tokyo RPG Factory has accomplished their implied mission statement: to make Japanese RPGs the way many of us remember them back in the day. As a result, I Am Setsuna walks in the footsteps of giants, and is thus dwarfed by the memories of games that inspired it. There are times when its familiar music and faces feel comforting, like returning to your hometown after a decade away, so as someone who grew up playing Japanese RPGs, I enjoyed my time with I Am Setsuna. It's like any trip down memory lane: it was nice to look back and remember the good times.",Journey with Setsuna as she prepares to make the ultimate sacrifice and save the people of her land.,7.2
68,Mat Paget,Teen,5,The Assembly,"Jul 19, 2016"," Virtual reality works best when games utilize it in ways that are inherently unique to the technology. Still, plenty of developers shoehorn games into VR that fail to live up to the technology's potential. Unfortunately, The Assembly falls into this category. The Assembly is a first-person adventure game that throws you into the deep end of an ongoing story. A group of underground scientists--the titular Assembly--conduct experiments without the government standing over its shoulder. You take on the role of two different scientists: new recruit Madeleine Stone, and Caleb Pearson, a veteran looking for a way out. These characters only come into contact with each other for a brief period of time; otherwise, their stories are separate. Stone, a scientist whose career was recently ruined, is undergoing trials to see if she's fit to join The Assembly. These trials will, at times, involve simple tasks like moving blocks around or choosing the right shapes. Other puzzles, however, expect you to move around the environment to inspect various objects, listen to audio tapes, or use in-game terminals to gleen information. These trials can be compelling; investigating a simulated murder to uncover the culprit is an unexpected-yet-captivating twist. Some of these quests push Stone to confront her past, though the game doesn't offer you enough of a chance to care about the character before it throws you into her troubled family history. This makes the choices feel less impactful than they should. Pearson, on the other hand, discovers that The Assembly is creating something sinister based on his past research, which prompts him to take all the evidence he can find to expose the organization. His path is definitely the more interesting of the two and makes The Assembly feel like a dystopian society, where ""The Man"" is always watching. You travel through the facilities, identifying evidence and solving simple puzzles. Pearson will talk to himself, letting you know what you need to find or do. His story goes in some intriguing directions, but it seems to stop short just as you start to get engaged. Unfortunately, neither story feels climactic in any way. It's more like you're looking in on a day in the life of the secretive scientific organization. This makes the narrative feel aimless and unsatisfying, despite the promising premise. With a bit more time, fleshing out, and room to breathe, this tale could’ve been a lot more intriguing. Some characters are introduced with little to no explanation as to who they are, and The Assembly would tell a much more entertaining, effective tale if you were allowed to spend more time learning about the world before arriving at story beats. As it is, the story is delivered at a pace that feels like it works against itself, making it hard to care about the game's events. You experience The Assembly through a VR headset or playing it on a screen. I tried both, and the experience felt better outside of VR. I felt motion-sick in VR a couple times, specifically when moving through the facility on a wheelchair-like device or using an elevator. This problem didn't occur outside of these sequences, however, as you can travel through the world by teleporting from one spot to another. Teleporting in VR gets tiresome, though, especially when you're trying to find the optimal spot to look at a specific object in the environment. Stone's trials are much easier to accomplish outside of VR, since you can move faster and look around more easily with the analog sticks. If you can handle the locomotion, you can use the analog sticks to move in VR. Viewing The Assembly's world through a VR headset won't enhance the experience, either. The most it offers is the chance to move around its environment, which doesn't feel like enough of an incentive to jump into an Oculus Rift. It doesn't feel like you're living in the world. Stone and Pearson's disembodied voices come from what’s supposed to be your virtual body, which makes you feel even more disconnected from the game. Elements like these, coupled with the non-optimal control experience, make it difficult to recommend playing The Assembly in VR. The Assembly feels like a small part of a bigger, much more engaging game. It's a good foundation for a world full of mystery, but it ends just as it starts to get interesting. A game that fully explores the dystopian facility, its history, and the state of the outside world is something I'd be interested in. However, as it is, The Assembly is hard to recommend.  ","The Assembly is an immersive adventure in VR where there are two sides to everything. An experience where perspectives shift, the right choice is never clear, and a question is always left open: When does the end justify the means?",6
69,Peter Brown,Teen,8,Headlander,"Jul 26, 2016"," If you've ever stepped into Samus Aran's boots for a Metroid adventure, you'll instantly recognize parallels in Headlander's world structure, outfits, and animations. It doesn't beat around the bush: you shoot laser guns, explore sprawling maps, and hunt for hidden power-ups--Metroid in a nutshell. On the other hand, years of experience with Samus can't prepare you for Headlander's lead character: a head in a rocket-powered jar. Without a body to call home, you have to decapitate robots and steal their bodies to fight back. This is but one of many refreshing concepts on display, not the least of which is a stylized 70s sci-fi aesthetic that's immediately appealing. Headlander is dripping with color, laced with humor, and anything but typical. This side-scrolling adventure takes place in a world populated by hedonist robots, who at any given moment are tripping out, trying to get laid, or dancing--just another day in the Pleasure Dome. The denizens' penchant for all things pleasurable is Headlander's primary source of humor, but you find that even service robots--that provide maps and dust floors--offer multiple lines of entertaining dialogue. That said, I could do without the sardonic AI that mans the game's security doors: I know you lead a repetitive life, but don't poison the Pleasure Dome's inkwell with your attitude. You're guided through this world by a man named Earl--a voice on the other side of your communication equipment--who's trying to help you escape the clutches of the lead AI, Methuselah. Earl's southern drawl and lackadaisical personality are a breath of fresh air, portraying a level-headed and helpful gentlemen in a sea of far-out characters. Methuselah fills the perfunctory antagonist role, but your interactions with him are minimal. Headlander puts gameplay and moment-to-moment interactions with quippy NPCs ahead of its overarching story, but the game as a whole is so delightfully entertaining that it's hard to feel too bad about that. When Earl first jars you from a deep sleep, you awake in a state of shock. Without a body, you can't speak or fire back at gun-toting robots. As you venture through the Pleasure Dome and beyond into the belly of Methesula's fortress, you take over robot bodies to gain access to weapons and security doors. Robot bodies are color-coded to security levels, and with each new level, the shots from those robots' laser rifles bounce off one additional surface. Lasers can be used to open doors if you can't walk up to them with a body intact, which becomes necessary for one very important reason: you can't jump. It's a weird omission at first blush, but once you get used to flying your head around in low gravity--a satisfying experience on its own--you quickly forget why you cared about the lack of jumping in the first place. Your head has unlimited propulsion and vacuum power, and it is graceful in flight, carrying momentum and turning on a dime if it needs to. To take over a new host, you can either propel into them to knock their head off after you've upgraded your helmet's thrusters, or use your vacuum ability to pull it off. When you've upgraded your abilities further by collecting scattered bits of energy, you can head-butt other robots to swap heads in a flash. Every victim you possess has its own life bar, but the one associated with your helmet is the one that really matters. Thankfully, it replenishes automatically over a short period of time, so it's easy to recharge if you can fly into a corner and tuck yourself away for a few seconds. Even if you manage to die, Headlander is extremely forgiving, allowing you--in most cases--to respawn in the same room. Multi-stage boss fights and objectives are the only exception, where you are forced to restart from the beginning of your task upon death. This is only troublesome during the game's two boss fights, where death comes at the drop of a hat should you fly erratically and wander into a projectile. The last boss is especially frustrating because it's uniquely challenging--remember, Headlander is typically forgiving, allowing you to play fast and loose--and despite clearly providing tools during the fight to inflict damage, the best way to fight that boss boils down to ramming your head into his weak point and retreating for cover. On your way to Methuselah's doorstep, you are sent on a lot of fetch quests, but it isn't as bad as it sounds: paths contain battle sequences and puzzles that require you to deftly swap bodies and survive stretches of hazardous corridors to arrive at your destination with a specific type of robot. While the shooting could be better, its twitchy nature isn't damning. You control the trajectory of your shots by aiming with the right analog stick, and there are many puzzles and fights that require you to angle your shots just so. Frustration is inevitable when you're carefully aiming shots and enemies keep respawning and firing at you, but these occasions rarely require more than two attempts to overcome. In many cases, you can resort to using your head when a gun proves difficult in the moment; outside of clearing security doors, your head's capabilities are adequate the majority of the time. This flexibility is greatly appreciated, allowing you to run and gun or zip around and decapitate enemies as you wish. When you aren't dead set on accomplishing a mission, you can veer to the corners of maps and hunt for upgrades, or for large doses of energy that you can invest into abilities that manifest when you inhabit a body. The biggest upgrade your head gets is a powerful dash, but there are numerous powerful upgrades that activate when you pilot bodies, which include a rainbow-colored armor aura and the ability to abandon bodies that continuously fire their weapons--essentially turning them into turrets. It will take the entire game to gain enough energy to unlock every upgrade, but it seems like incremental upgrades for your helmet lie in wait around every other corner. The result is an experience like Metroid where your desire to explore is handsomely rewarded, but the pace is sped up, making for an ever-present reward loop. The 10 or so hours it takes to beat Headlander are packed with glimmering visual effects and great tunes that range from light-hearted lounge music to overbearing synth tracks. It's a weird and infectious world that feels like the perfect playground for Headlander's quirky and engaging action. Minus one boss fight and an odd instance of major slow-down in a treacherous labyrinth filled with bouncing lasers, there's rarely a bump in the road that proves significant enough to disrupt the joys of flying around as a head, decapitating robots, and taking over bodies against the game's absurd and colorful backdrop. From its odd mechanics to its captivating presentation, Headlander's parallels to Metroid bubble under the surface; it's the game's fresh qualities that grab your attention and make it one of the most delightful takes on the well-worn formula in years.",Headlander is a game from Double Fine that is being published by Adult Swim Games.,7.5
70,Edmond Tran,,9,Quadrilateral Cowboy,"Jul 25, 2016"," The year is 1980. Hoverbikes are in vogue, and so are 1920’s Italian opera and portable vinyl record players. You’re in the midst of breaking into a highly secured villa, and the safe you’re there to grab is surrounded by lasers, just as you expected. You throw down your clunky laptop and after a flurry of determined keystrokes, you smack the Enter button. Elsewhere in the complex, your strategically-placed briefcase opens up to deploy a rifle, which swivels and fires a round to hit a switch, just as you programmed. The lasers disappear and you spring to action, forcing both the safe and yourself through a glass window, three stories down, straight onto the extraction point just seconds before the alarm triggers. Objective complete. You return home and celebrate a successful mission with your accomplices in style--by eating instant ramen. Quadrilateral Cowboy is a game with two distinct kinds of experiences. The first: tense, Mission: Impossible-style heists, which take place in a variety of death-defying scenarios, and challenge you to use logic, computer hacking and a variety of unique gadgets to complete criminal objectives. The second: quiet, peaceful moments that take place in the homes and hideouts of your protagonist and her accomplices, which give you a sense of their relationships with one another, and immerses you in the game’s unconventional setting. The world of Quadrilateral Cowboy is a bizarre, retro-futuristic collage. It embraces cutting-edge technology from the early 1980’s and injects that clunky, analog aesthetic into a cyberpunk ethos. The game’s fascination with analog technology, as well as the physical manipulation of technology, blankets the setting. You insert cassette tapes to retrieve data. You flip through spiral-bound instruction manuals. To save your game, you have to wrench a lever on a six-foot magnetic tape machine. One of the first things you’re required to do is build a computer by installing each individual part into the motherboard; pop in the CPU, drill-in the power supply, and plug in that massive stick of 256k RAM. Then, there’s the physicality of the game’s primary mechanic, hacking. Hacking is a joy. In Quadrilateral Cowboy’s heist scenarios--towering skyscrapers, high-speed truck chases, space stations, to name a few--the purpose of hacking isn’t to break into computer mainframes, but rather manipulate the physical environment to open doors, disarm lasers, and remotely operate some of the game’s unique gadgets like miniature robots and deployable turrets. The commands you must learn and physically type out on your own clacky keyboard are not particularly complicated. But what makes the act of hacking incredibly fulfilling is the physicality of your hacking deck, the complexity of command strings required later in the game, and how you’re required to move and interact within the complex, tangible effects of a successful hack. Before hacking, you need to physically equip your hacking deck and place it on a surface, and although perspective zooms to the terminal screen once the deck boots up, you are still completely free to look around and observe your environment. Looking around with the mouse when you need to be typing with both hands can be cumbersome, but what makes this feature incredibly gratifying is that you can immediately see the impact of commands you execute. When unlocking a door, you can type the necessary command into the hacking terminal, move your perspective to look past the in-game hacking screen and at the door, confidently hit the ""enter"" button, and immediately see the effect. The physical placement of your deck and what you can see while operating it becomes a necessary part of missions later in the game, where observation of the environment becomes key in knowing exactly when to manipulate it. You have to know when to deactivate lasers to allow a moving object to slip through without triggering an alarm, for example. In another case, you may need to wirelessly connect a gadget’s camera to an additional CRT screen, separate from your hacking deck, in order to monitor the situation from a distance. In cases like this, it’s crucial to consider that the physical placement of your CRT screen needs to be in a position where you can both observe the images your remote device is beaming back, while also being able to see the information on your hacking deck so you can give it the correct commands. The missions in Quadrilateral Cowboy eventually culminate in a number of complex situations where you not only need to observe the nature of environmental obstacles blocking your path, but learn to plan ahead and program a sequence of commands to be automatically executed with precise timing. Some of the game’s most thrilling moments had me code a lengthy algorithm, double-check it for mistakes, hit ""enter"", and immediately dash through a series of dangers that were disabled just as I reached them, and reactivated as soon as I passed. This is cyber espionage action at its finest. Although learning a breadth of hacking commands sounds daunting, it isn’t. Quadrilateral Cowboy very gradually introduces new mechanical concepts, commands, and gadgets with each heist mission to slowly help you build a base of knowledge. Each individual mission can last from one to 20 minutes depending on your skill, and each does an excellent job in making you feel like a genuine hacker each time you accomplish something new. In the final missions of the game, I found myself doing the equivalent of in-game touch-typing--keeping my perspective on the hacking target rather than the hacking deck, and entering reams of commands sight-unseen, beaming with confidence. There are only a couple of instances where the game’s mechanics disappointed. One of the final obstacles in the game demanded much more dexterity, rather than programming prowess, to overcome. The other disappointment is in regards to the tag-team mechanic introduced later in the game, where you’re given the ability to take control of different characters with different skillsets. These missions require you to go in as Character A, essentially “record” a series of actions, back out and rewind, change to Character B, and then act in tandem with the previous character’s actions. This mechanic is executed well despite some minor technical hiccups, but is only used for two proper heists before never appearing again. It’s a shame to see this feature under-used, although the game’s integrated Steam Workshop functionality does allow the opportunity for custom maps to be made. The other side to Quadrilateral Cowboy’s coin, the quiet moments between the missions, are just as strong as its heists. The game has no explicit storyline and no dialogue to drive events forward. Instead, what is provided are a number of short, but minutely detailed interactive vignettes that give insight into particular characters, their relationships with each other, and the slightly off-kilter world they inhabit. Those familiar with some of the developer’s previous games--Thirty Flights of Loving and Gravity Bone--will have an idea of what to expect. These dioramas are filled with details, meaningful flavour text, and can be explored at the player’s leisure. I got as much gratification from staring at a collection of photographs on a bedroom wall, trying to piece together the backstory of these characters, as I did from perfectly executing a string of command-line prompts with my hacking terminal while on top of a moving train. One of the most memorable scenes of the game involved just hanging out with the characters on a rooftop at sunset, and enjoying the moment. When Quadrilateral Cowboy ended, I was left feeling a distinct and poignant fondness for the characters and the journey we’d all been on, despite never speaking to them. Quadrilateral Cowboy succeeds in astonishing ways: It makes you feel like an incredibly accomplished computer hacker and agent of espionage. It creates an eccentric, thorough world that feels good to exist in and creates characters you can empathise with, despite the lack of a clear plot thread. Quadrilateral Cowboy presents you with a spectrum of moments, and each moment makes you feel great.  ",,6.7
71,Brett Todd,Teen,6,Necropolis,"Jul 12, 2016"," Hardcore roguelike traditionalists may find a lot to like in Necropolis, which goes heavy on atmosphere with its spooky, retro-flavored environs and even heavier on tense combat with the threat of permadeath looming overhead. But there isn’t much beneath the surface. While Necropolis compels you to explore the underworld for a few hours, shallow design and frustration eventually make you eager to find that exit back to the surface. Everything here emphasizes simplicity. Instead of creating a character, you get male and female rogues with slightly different looks and colors (and eerie glowing eyes beneath cowls) and the option of heading into the dungeon alone or with up to three buddies. Instead of diving into the usual fantasy-flavored epic saga, you presented with a straightforward objective: “here’s the Necropolis built by the Archmage Abraxis--try to get out of it alive.” The Necropolis is packed with procedural yet generic dungeon levels populated by a sparse roster of enemies that drop a limited amount of loot. Necropolis’ visuals evoke the early days of 3D back in the mid-90s. The emphasis is on the big polygons and sharp edges that dominated gaming 20 years ago, when imagination was still required to bring settings like this to life. Some of this actually tips over the edge into the surreal and even a little spooky, with numerous odd touches. The audio is an eerie collection of piano plinks, horror-movie orchestral and techno surges like something out of a midnight fright film. Sound also includes distinctive, unsettling monster screams, plus the rumblings of a bizarre dungeon narrator called the Brazen Head, who comments on your life-and-death struggles like a game-show host. Some of this old-school approach works. The graphics and sound are especially effective, giving the game a shot of nostalgia that seems appropriate for such an ancient genre. Dungeon chambers and corridors feature gloomy shadows, neon light effects, and even a few sci-fi touches--such as the pyramid robots that patrol the corridors, collecting loot and blowing up in your face. The look evokes Dungeons & Dragons by way of Tron. Even the flimsy storyline kind of works, thanks to the sarcastic Brazen Head. You always get the sense that nobody is taking the proceedings all that seriously, which works well in an arcade roguelike that’s more about clocking high scores than role-playing. But at times, the game is unrelentingly traditional, slavishly sticking to old-school difficulty. Necropolis is extreme and unforgiving--permadeath is the default setting, not an option. Die here, and you go all the way back to the entrance and start over. The one saving grace is that you can get into a groove after the first couple of hours and come to grips with both the combat system and the way that crafting allows you to load up on health-replenishing food and potions that buff your combat skills. The game is always brutal, but at least it gives you a fighting chance to survive for a while as long as you’re smart and don’t rush heedlessly into combat. Disappointingly, new weapons, armor, potions, arcane codexes, and the like are offered up with no identification at all. Even when you get to know the game’s limited stock of goodies and gear or use a scroll to identify this stuff, you still get nothing to tell you what they actually do beyond vague one-line descriptions. One type of sword, for instance, is described as ""better to wield in combat than a rabbit"". A codex called ""Berzerking: Get That Party Started"" is summed up with “Is hit. Is other hit. Soon, all hit. Much good.” Nothing comes with labeled stats, either, aside from a single digit denoting the level of the item in question. That means trial-and-error experimentation is almost always required when you want to discover if an item is something you want to use, or leave with the corpse of the bad guy who handed it off with his dying groan. Battles are always intense, due to the specter of permadeath hanging over the entire game. Monster mobs increase with every level as you venture farther down into the dungeon. Enemy types may not be that varied, but the game provides plenty of skeletons, spectral thugs, robotic knights, and giant spiders to deal with, and they respawn freely enough that you always have to watch your back. Combat mechanics afford the easy and free-flowing ability to attack, dodge, and block. You can also chain combos together and hold a button to charge attacks. When you have a bit of breathing room, you can pull off satisfying whirling dervish-style sword assaults and Thor-like slams into the ground. But battles can also spin out of control. Because of the way you push forward with every sword thrust, it’s all too easy to accidently go through or sidestep an enemy and end up behind them--which rewards your foe with a free shot or three before you can reposition. This can be bad news in heavy mob scenes, where a single mistake like this can get you killed very quickly. The camera also gets in the way. Move close to walls, and both your character and the enemies are instantly obscured, making you a sitting duck. All of these issues seem noticeably harder to manage with the default keyboard-and-mouse controls. Be sure to plug in a gamepad if you have one, since it makes combat a little easier to handle and the camera easier to manage with the help of the right stick. Necropolis feels like a missed opportunity. Even though the game offers intense combat and an appealingly bizarre setting, there are just too many problems and limitations for it to hold your interest for very long. While the challenge inherent in the core roguelike formula adeptly applied here is enough all on its own to draw you in for multiple runs, you'll eventually tap out due to the weight of the grueling difficulty and repetition.  ","Necropolis is a game of brutal combat and survival, set in a magical deathtrap that shifts and reconstructs itself around you.",5.5
72,Miguel Concepcion,Teen,6,God Eater Resurrection,"Jun 28, 2016"," There’s an alluring sense of immediacy and simplicity to God Eater Resurrection. You jump into a mission knowing full well what your orders are, you carry out those directives, and you exfiltrate when the job is done. It’s the same kind of glamorized efficiency that makes spy fiction so appealing. The narrative device that improves on this premise is, of course, when things don’t go as planned, when the agent or squad must adapt to changing circumstances. It’s due to a shortage of these surprises, however, that God Eater Resurrection never transcends its safe, uncomplicated design. Resurrection’s world is candy-wrapped around an anime-influenced aesthetic and the medium’s ever-growing fascination with urban dystopias. Along with the variety of environments, there’s a lot of creativity to be found in the design of the enemies you’re sent to destroy: four-legged beasts with faces of old men, living iron maidens, and large bipedal lizards with stylish helmets. You play the newest member of a team of god-killing soldiers, a group of teens and 20-somethings who’ve managed to survive an apocalyptic event in which hostile demon-beasts dubbed “Aragami” took over the world. As with many teen-targeted manga-styled ensembles, the cast is a collection of distinct personalities with limited emotional capacities. All the tropes are here: the archetypically neurotic support teammate, the brooding all-business specialist, and the squad member whose bubbly, saccharine demeanor can be forgiven thanks to her usefulness in combat. Your custom character fits right in as the rookie who sounds self-assured no matter what voice type you pick. Your squad’s confidence in the face of humanity’s likely extinction is complemented by the extreme designs of their multipurpose God Arc weapons. Not only are these tools of destruction often larger than the people who wield them, but these gunblades also eat Aragami--hence the ""God Eater"" name. These echo the kind of transformable armaments found in Monster Hunter and Vanquish, only they’re infused with the ferocity of the beasts they kill. Resurrection’s faithfulness to the original PSP version, Gods Eater Burst, underscores its limitations. The original appealed to that specific on-the-go audience that enjoys brief play sessions. It’s a different set of expectations in the context of a console in a living room, where it feels more natural to tear through a dozen missions in one sitting. It’s unfortunate that you can’t take on multiple assignments in Resurrection without enduring the time-consuming process of returning to base to assess your rewards after every mission. There isn’t depth in combat so much as there are multiple moments in a fight where you need to adapt to changes in an Aragami’s behavior. When it’s enraged, you keep your distance, and when it tries to escape, you give chase. It’s like a chess match where the opponent always gets to make the first move. While the majority of the sorties are involved, there’s little room for improvisation. You can pick up the pace of play by using attacks that capitalize on an enemy’s elemental weaknesses, using consumable enhancements, and, most significantly, using the God Arc to bite a chunk off the Aragami. These mid-conflict opportunities not only provide a temporary stat boost for your customized protagonist but to your teammates as well, provided you can spare a couple of seconds to shoot your buddies with Aragami-infused ammo. Yes, you have to fire at your squad. It's unusual, but it sure beats having to run up to them to enhance their abilities. The straightforwardness of Resurrection’s missions is both its greatest strength and most frustrating weakness. There’s comfort in knowing what you’re getting into and in the specificity of your missions. Unfortunately, it takes less than a few dozen quests before monotony sets in. There’s a modicum of gratification in maxing out your gear to keep up with the increasing difficulty of every subsequent batch of missions, yet there’s also a palpable sense of routine, since the Aragami throw very few curveballs. This uncomplicated approach has one bright spot: It’s easy to manage your team, which is both self-sufficient and made up of meaningful contributors. Given that boss battles can reach a frenetic pace, it’s often more sensible to leave your buddies to their own devices. The simplicity of the maps reinforces this level of ease. Resurrection avoids the Monster Hunter-style loading-screen tedium of chasing your prey from area to area. A ranged strike from anyone on your team will stop a fleeing Aragami. Rarely does a target use the terrain effectively enough to find respite for longer than a few seconds. There’s a bit more depth to be found in Resurrection's customized gear and crafting systems. Player progression doesn’t rely on gaining experience through kills but rather on weapon upgrades and other improvements. The challenge lies in ensuring you’re well-rounded enough to have a countermeasure for every enemy type. It’s a compelling judgment game to build a small collection of melee weapons that address every possible Aragami weakness, whether that’s through crushing, piercing, or slashing attacks. Then you have to factor in the weight of each weapon in the field and to determine how much damage you can deal per second. The one downside? There’s no item or weapon so rare or exceedingly useful that would warrant replays of any operation. Aragami item drops and the mission-completion rewards are abundant enough that you’ll always have items to craft and gear to enhance. Beyond crafting and buying new gear, there’s little reason to spend time at your base, despite the game’s implication to the contrary. Conversations with NPCs are mostly superficial, save for the occasional chat that triggers the next batch of missions. HQ is merely a poorly created illusion of a grander base of operations, especially given the organization’s in-game role in saving humanity. For as much as Gods Eater Burst excelled in 2010, it’s since been outpaced by similar games. That includes prey mounting in Monster Hunter and a more engrossing atmosphere in Toukiden: Kiwami. There’s comfort to be found in the simple mission goals, but it’s impossible to ignore how repetitive they are--and how outdated they make Resurrection feel in practice.",God Eater Resurrection is an action RPG from Bandai Namco.,7.4
73,Tamoor Hussain,Mature,8,Batman: The Telltale Series,"Aug 2, 2016"," For years now, Telltale Games has masterfully exploited our fear of making the wrong decision. Its games tell you every action you take has a consequence, then light a fuse and watch as you stumble over impossible decisions. But when you're Batman--the world's most cool, calm and collected detective--Telltale's emotional manipulation shouldn't be as effective. Decision paralysis holds no power over the Dark Knight. Therein lies the challenge: How do you make a character known for being decisive and infallible falter? Telltale's solution is to shift the focus away from Batman and dig into Bruce Wayne instead, a decision that proves to be the right one. Episode One, Realm of Shadows, effectively makes the man more important than the hero, and provides a strong start to the series. With Harvey Dent running for mayor and Bruce as his most vocal backer, Gotham City is on the verge of changing for the better. Together they threaten the status quo, where corrupt city officials are in the pocket of criminals. The citizens of Gotham may not be sold on Dent, but they hold the Wayne reputation and word in high-regard. This dynamic is what Telltale plays with to create tension. Many of the choices in Episode One aren't matters of life and death, but they still weigh heavy. You're forced to choose between what you personally think is right, what you think Bruce Wayne would do, and what you believe will help Harvey's campaign. Do you shake Carmine Falcone's hand to secure his support, potentially tarnishing your own reputation? Or do you turn him away, knowing those same hands are drowning Gotham in crime? The situations are often understated, but always dramatic. The nagging knowledge that choices and actions have profound consequences pull you in different directions and make you second-guess. They also lay the foundation for something far more intriguing. Like all good Batman stories, catching a criminal leads to a larger mystery, one that challenges the moral foundations guiding Bruce and, by extension, Batman. Since it's a self-contained story, Telltale can take creative liberties with characters and canon. For the most part, the faces are familiar. Alfred is keeping Bruce from being consumed by his crusade, Harvey Dent is the hand reaching into the darkness to pull Gotham out, and Selina Kyle is a selfish thief with hints of good in her. But there are elements of these characters that are reimagined in subtle ways. For some it's their personalities, for others it's relationships. One notable character is completely reinvented and will play a pivotal role in the story, but it's ominously unclear how. Bruce, meanwhile, is early in his career as Batman and more emotionally unsettled. As a result dialogue responses can be used to craft the version of him you want. You can be the aloof victim of tragedy, the self-centered billionaire playboy, the hopeful friend, or the silent brooder. Since Telltale's excellent writing has a way of making it difficult to roleplay a single type, you're more likely to get a mixture of all of them. The emotional variety paints a Bruce that hasn't hardened and isn't hiding behind the mask yet. Instead he feels human and genuine. It's an interesting take on the character that extends into his crime-fighting alter ego. This may be a Bruce Wayne story, but when the going gets tough, the tough put on a Batman suit. Some of the episode's standout moments involve Batman because Telltale has built gameplay around conducting investigations and solving puzzles. This aspect of Batman's character is core to his identity, but has been sorely underexplored in games. Like other Telltale Games, players can interact with elements of their surroundings. In this case, it's all evidence used to piece together what happened. What transpires in Episode One isn't a simple case of cops versus robbers: there are chemicals, tire tracks, shrapnel, and other pieces to the puzzle. Players physically walk between these and draw a holographic line connecting the relevant evidence together. Although Batman's lethargic walk speed can make it time consuming, a recreation of the event courtesy of the Cowl's holographic interface is a fitting reward for solving the conundrum. Another set-piece involves fighting through a room full of thugs by inspecting them and linking them to nearby objects, just like with connecting pieces of evidence. Once again, the Cowl's holographic interface runs a simulation, so you can choose whether you prefer to slam a guard into a concrete pillar or launch him into a screen door; to tackle another thug or throw a priceless art-piece at his head (tip: do this one). Once an attack plan is formulated, there's the execution phase. This works exactly like action sequences in other Telltale games, with a series of timed button presses and analog stick swipes to punch, kick, dodge, and move. In designing combat this way, Telltale has keenly honed in on another kernel of the Batman character: methodical preparation and tactical prowess. However, this comes at the cost of feeling his raw power and ferociousness. Somewhere between pressing a button and watching Batman tear through goons, the energy dissipates. The disconnect deepens when you stop pressing buttons altogether and notice that Batman continues to lay waste to his enemies with little to no change in his performance. The only time you're punished for missing your cues is if it's the final blow, which needs to land to progress onto the next scene. Otherwise, you're just losing out on filling a meter used for a special cinematic attack. While not as distinct as the neon noir of The Wolf Among Us, Telltale’s Batman has a gritty visual identity in keeping with the property. Thick marker-like lines accentuate finer details in characters, and ambient lighting brings some vibrancy to the game. A wall of screens fills the Batcave with a futuristic blue hue, and in the Wayne Manor a roaring fire brings warmth to the dark corners the living room. Moonlight coats Batman's suit, cutting that iconic silhouette into the Gotham sky, and dim street lamps create an air of danger on the seedy streets. Batman’s outfit is particularly cool, with the stubby ears of Frank Miller’s incarnation paying homage to his legacy, and Greg Capullo’s streamlined biker suit style representing the more modern design. His glowing white eyes give him an imposing presence, making his victims look like deer caught headlights as he bears down on them. While many fixate on breaking the Batman, Telltale wants to bring down Bruce Wayne, and it demonstrates an understanding that people and relationships are the key to this. Episode one begins the process of unravelling him, and sets the stage to lay him bare. Impressively, by sticking to its strengths, Telltale also delivers on the experience of being Batman. Realm of Shadows establishes a compelling Bruce Wayne narrative and is an exciting start to the series.","Enter the fractured pysche of Bruce Wayne in this dark and violent new story from the award-winning creators of The Walking Dead - A Telltale Games Series. Batman - The Telltale Series comes to retail as a Season Pass Disc, which includes Episode One, and grants access to the remaining four episodes in the season as they become available to download. The Season Pass Disc will give you access to a total of 5 episodes as they become available.",7.2
74,Scott Butterworth,Everyone,9,ABZU,"Aug 2, 2016"," When I die, I hope whatever happens next is even half as beautiful as Abzu. Its mesmerizing soundtrack and Wind Waker-esque visuals are among the most enrapturing in recent memory, yet the game's true beauty stems not from its bittersweet score and inviting undersea environments but from its unfailing ability to imbue every moment with childlike wonder. Abzu is serene and meditative, calming and cathartic, moving and timeless, its simple components assembled so elegantly as to become something altogether richer. There's a striking sort of purity about Abzu that invites comparison to another, equally powerful game: Journey. As in Journey, Abzu's characters are nameless, its story wordless, its campaign brief. It also eschews many mechanics we might consider standard for a modern adventure/exploration game, including combat, character progression, and fail states. It even lacks the ambient multiplayer that made Journey such a profound experience for many players. But Abzu finds meaning in other places and, like Journey, evokes a vast array of emotions with grace and ease. Though the campaign follows a linear path, you're typically free to explore areas at your own pace, following subtle environmental cues toward hidden details or grasping on to massive creatures like orcas and manta rays as they glide effortlessly through the blazing blue water. You can even pause to ""meditate"" at certain statues, allowing you to experience the world from the perspective of the animals around you. Doing so doesn't earn you anything; it's simply an opportunity to observe and enjoy the thriving ecosystems layered into every environment. With lush kelp forests, pink coral reefs, and murky black trenches, Abzu captures the otherworldly beauty of the ocean and populates each breathtaking backdrop with its own unique fauna. You'll find all manner of fish, sharks, eels, whales, crustaceans, and more, all of which behave believably. And yet, somehow, I never felt threatened--curious, awestruck, even intimidated, but never threatened. There's something profoundly peaceful about drifting through that world with no score or objectives or heads-up display to break the spell. That's not to say, however, that Abzu abandons gameplay completely. In fact, the swimming itself feels surprisingly satisfying, thanks in part to the game's novel control scheme. You swim straight ahead by simply squeezing the right trigger, leaving you to look around with the right stick and change direction with the left. Regardless of how you twist and maneuver, your character fluidly adapts to your every input. Meanwhile, tapping X with the proper rhythm builds up your boost, allowing you to flit gracefully through obstacles and breach into the air if you speed toward the surface. Silly as that may sound, it's actually pretty exhilarating, especially when you can entice a school of fish to swim alongside you or get dolphins to flip and squeak almost as if they're playing with you. Abzu is also more than a simple ocean-life simulator. As you push forward, you'll encounter several straight-forward exploration puzzles and even a few tense moments of action, but more importantly, you'll begin to dive deeper and deeper into the game's unspoken narrative. You'll uncover some strange yet adorable robots almost immediately and start to notice scattered ruins of an ancient civilization shortly thereafter. The further you progress, the more exquisite the ruins grow, with gilded paintings, intricate tile work, and ornate, Moroccan-style windows hinting at some tragic past. Suffice it to say the game grows in some truly unexpected and borderline mind-blowing ways. Later areas and gameplay evolutions, though simple, prove remarkably affecting within the context of the experience, cleverly subverting expectations established by the game's earlier portions. Of course, Abzu isn't perfect. The camera occasionally clips through larger objects, for example, and the mechanics walk a very fine line between minimalist and just straight-up simplistic. But these shortcoming are utterly inconsequential in the face of Abzu's countless artistic triumphs--like the music. The soundtrack shifts dynamically as you progress through the environments, stitching together various compositions on the fly to create a mood that matches your surroundings without explicitly calling attention to itself. And that's not all. At certain moments, the camera slowly pulls back to communicate the overwhelming scale of certain creatures and environments. I swam eye to eye with a blue whale and have never felt more awestruck or insignificant in a video game. On another occasion, I emerged from a tight cavern and was suddenly enveloped by a vast, empty chasm with an endless darkness beneath me. Again, the deft camerawork turned an already memorable moment into something truly incredible. Art exists to bridge a gap, to communicate emotions or ideas that would otherwise be impossible to articulate. Abzu does this--courageously, confidently, sincerely. Its stirring soundtrack, vivid colors, subtle storytelling, living world, and thoughtful execution combine to create a singularly moving, transcendent experience. In a word: Abzu is beautiful.","ABZÛ is an epic descent into the depths of the sea, where players will explore beautifully rendered ocean environments with fluid swimming controls.",6.9
75,Alex Gilyadov,,7,This Is the Police,"Jul 28, 2016"," After a long night filled with nightmares and lingering thoughts, you arrive at the police station early in the morning. A threatening note from the city’s biggest crime boss has been carefully placed at your work desk. He needs you to do some “favors” for him in exchange for your life--and a large sum of cash. The station’s already short on staff, but now you must send your best beat cops to do the Mafia’s bidding and ignore calls of distress from innocent citizens. The results aren’t pretty: Crooks get away with heinous crimes, while victims lie dead in the streets. This Is the Police gives you a glimpse of the pressure-packed day-to-day world of Freeburg’s struggling police chief, Jack Boyd. After an investigation goes wrong, the mayor and the rest of city hall want to push the veteran Boyd out the door and plan to replace him with a fresh face. Boyd only has 180 days left to clean up the streets and make half a million dollars for his retirement. Boyd’s last days as police chief are a tumultuous journey riddled with danger and shocking twists. The gripping story sports plenty of memorable scenes, all of which are presented as a colorful newspaper-style comic strip, playing well with the game's minimalist art style and muted color pallet. Jack Boyd doesn’t stand out visually as you can barely make out his face, but his deep voice--courtesy of Duke Nukem actor, John St. John--leaves a lasting impression. Boyd’s a compelling antihero, with decades of crime fighting under his belt, and a somewhat jaded personality to show for it. His checkered career has touched a lot of people, some for better and others for worse, leading to tense and poignant exchanges as you near the end of his career. Gameplay is an enjoyable and challenging mix of point-and-click adventure and management sim. You take control of two shifts of police officers and detectives and solve crimes via an isometric map of Freeburg. You start each day trying to pick the most well-rested squad, then respond to procedurally-generated events that pop on the map. You don’t actually see crimes play out; instead they’re presented as images and lines of text. Gameplay--like choosing which cops and detectives to send out on jobs--is distilled down to interacting with a few sleek menus. While the challenges start out relatively simple and easy--the earlier crimes aren’t all too serious, requiring just a pair of cops to resolve--their complexity grows in short order. A bank robbery forces you to send a half-dozen cops alongside a SWAT team and a paddy wagon, while a domestic-violence case only requires a couple of officers. You can spot a visual timer on the images of the officers you sent out as each crime takes a different amount of time to stop. A bank robbery will take 30 seconds longer to end than a misdemeanor, like a homeless disturbing people. The real strategy here is figuring out how to best make use of your squad. If you send all of your best employees out on one job, you risk not being able to stop other unlawful acts. You're forced to think on your feet and be decisive, knowing full well that things can go south at any second. One time four of my best officers were gunned down during a car chase because I didn’t send a SWAT team to help. It was shocking, but it's this brutal unpredictably that makes This Is the Police so enthralling. You also make text-based choices during a few gameplay and story scenes, whether it’s answering questions during an interview or city hall interrogation, or choosing which crime family to side with during a gang war. The way you choose to approach an interrogation, for example, will determine if you’re guilty or innocent of corruption. If you pick the wrong answers then you risk having your police budget reduced, or even being sent to prison. Eventually city hall will start making seemingly ridiculous demands, like making you fire certain officers without reasonable cause. If you don’t comply or let too many crimes go unpunished, the mayor will reduce your police budget and squad. The Mob's contrasting demands make you second guess your decisions even further. If you don’t turn a blind eye to its serious crimes, you’ll be killed. But if you help and send your best employees to do their bidding, you’ll be rewarded with a large sum of cash you can spend on bribes. Making both parties--and your police squad--happy while trying to keep Freeburg safe requires thoughtful planning and skill. Consequently, being a police chief in this corrupt city has you make sacrifices and compromises you’d otherwise want to avoid. The stakes are always high. Some situations even force you to make a few life-or-death decisions. In your playthrough you might encounter someone who spotted a bomb hidden inside a duffel bag on a park bench. As the cops arrive at the scene, you have to make a few choices: shoot the bag, have the cops remove it themselves, or wait for the bomb squad to arrive. If you make the wrong decision, your best officers and a number of innocents will perish. Even if the game's more routine, mundane crimes grow repetitive over time, the choices you make during curveball events leave a memorable impact. A big letdown are the detectives. They work on investigations that take way too long to complete. The game also tries--and fails--to delve into some serious issues about racism, sexism, and police brutality. City hall orders you to specifically fire all cops that are black as part of the gameplay narrative. The game’s trying to point our attention to how awful and corrupt workplaces and state governments can be when it comes to these type of issues. This has the potential to be an interesting, risky scenario, but the end result lacks substance and disappoints. You either do the horrible deed, or you steadfastly refuse--and just fire one employee the next day on the mayor’s order. This Is the Police tries to depict the mayor as being corrupt and vile, but by ending the discussion there, it fails to examine the more important subjects it introduces--like race relations--in a meaningful way. Managing an entire city’s police force and saving lives, while also adhering to the demands of city hall and the Mob makes for a tense management sim. This Is the Police continually presents you with memorable and important choices that impact the story, and even though its most intriguing conflicts could benefit from more examination, the game is carried by a captivating antagonist. Jack Boyd has a hard time staying good in a city filled with vile people, and you won’t soon forget the time you spent in his shoes.","This Is the Police is a strategy/adventure game set in a city spiraling the drain. Taking the role of gritty Police Chief Jack Boyd, you'll dive into a deep story of crime and intrigue. Will Jack reach his retirement with a nice stack of bills, or will he end up broken ... or worse?",8
76,Justin Clark,,9,Kentucky Route Zero,"Feb 22, 2013"," The very first image you see in Act IV of Kentucky Route Zero is a mammoth. Not a real mammoth, though that wouldn't surprise anyone familiar with this series. No, a slow pull-away shot reveals the ostentatious, animatronic figurehead at the front of the Mucky Mammoth, a cramped yet lively boat helmed by a college dropout named Will who is supposed to be writing a book based on his college research. The vessel at Will's command is ferrying travelers down Lake Lethe, one of Kentucky Route Zero's literary references that may ultimately mean everything or nothing. If the allusion was deliberate, then it’s likely the Lethe of Greek myth, the waters where the dead come to forget who they once were so they can travel through the afterlife unburdened. It would explain quite a bit about Kentucky Route Zero up to this point, though nothing about the series has offered such an easy explanation so far. If Lethe is merely a name, it’s simply a place of respite, fair greetings, and weary, nostalgic travels for the denizens of the abstract nowhere place Kentucky Route Zero portrays. It could be this, but that also wouldn’t explain all the magic that has happened, does happen, and will happen while traversing its space. Ultimately, there isn't a wrong or right answer because Kentucky Route Zero isn't a game about answers, but of journeys. There’s an overarching plot--the deceptively mundane quest to deliver grizzled old trucker Conway's last load of antiques to Dogwood Drive--but that started to become a tertiary concern somewhere around Act III. That isn’t to say that Act IV suffers for it. Almost effortlessly, it upholds the same captivating writing and storytelling of its predecessors. All it means is that the focus is shifting. At some point, the end goal lost priority to experiencing the trip with Conway's cohorts and finding a new purpose along the way. Suddenly, Conway is no longer our anchor to Kentucky Route Zero's strange universe. Instead, the entirety of the episode takes place aboard the Mucky Mammoth as it sails across Lake Lethe, making frequent stops along the way. The gameplay is still fundamentally the same, using rudimentary point-and-click mechanics to let you nagivate small environments. You select dialogue and actions from a menu at certain points, but they dictate the flow of a conversation for its own sake rather than garnering good/evil points as you careen toward a moment of reckoning. In this episode, each stop the Mucky Mammoth makes gives you the opportunity to choose a perspective. The child, Ezra, might stay on the boat to pick up strange sounds with a tape recorder, listen to recordings of Will's university lectures on the nature of death, or choose to follow his friends ashore to play in the woods. What you learn about life, other people, and the seemingly endless cruise down the lake is entirely in the player's hands, and the only compass is one's own curiosity. If there is anything resembling a consequence of the change in perspective, Act IV does lack a certain urgency compared to its predecessors. Acts I through III made it very easy to become lost in a character's story--stuck in a loop of Moebius strip highways trying to find the next destination or very literally transported somewhere else by a song. There was still a true north through it all, however, in Conway's search for the Zero, the route to reach Dogwood Drive and complete his last run. He would still get lost and injured, but there was always the end to consider. True north no longer exists here. The events of Act III caused Conway to surrender to his new duties ahead of schedule, making his dedication to finding Dogwood Drive unreliable at best. Act IV flits among the rest of his menagerie instead, their disparate journeys showing the first signs of divergence toward a new purpose. Act IV reinforces the general feeling of the first three acts, the persistent theme of obsolete people coming to the Zero to do obsolete jobs, where the only reward is the work itself. The American Dream is in perpetual deferment here, never to be achieved by those who live there but something to be built on the foundations of their hard work. When Johnny and Junebug stop at a floating gas station for snacks, the attendant speaks of his lowly duty as isolating but dignified, a step in a larger journey for others. There's something spiritual about being the engine behind the wonders of the world, and this act, in particular, has nothing but reverence for that idea. It's beautiful as a result--a beauty reflected in the brief, impressive glimpses we get of the world outside the Zero, a sumptuous, painterly place of color and abundance. It’s not enough to say that there’s nothing like Kentucky Route Zero. An intentionally threadbare but powerful art-style draws you into a spellbinding tale of accepted loss that's relatable in ways few games ever are. There’s power, wonder, even a bit of existential dread to be found in even the shortest conversation. They’re feelings that make this act's new, diverging path, an extraordinary experience. We're no closer to understanding the meaning behind this journey through Kentucky Route Zero, and it's hard to say if we'll even arrive at the point of it all during the game's fifth and final act. But Act IV proves the journey is everything, and what people take from and give to each other--even in the most desolate, purgatorial version of America imaginable--still matters. It's heartening thinking about what other players might take away from the stories shared during our motley crew's time sailing Lake Lethe--and what it might spur them to do in the real world.","Kentucky Route Zero is a magical realistic adventure game about a secret highway in the caves beneath Kentucky, and the mysterious folks who travel it.",8.9
77,Peter Brown,Teen,7,No Man's Sky,"Aug 9, 2016"," No Man's Sky is an exploration game set in a vast galaxy of over 18 quintillion planets. Each one is massive--too big for any one person to explore fully in the span of a day--and if you’re the first to discover one, you not only get to name it, you also get first dibs on any discoveries contained within. This is a game about travel, survival, and commerce, backed by impressive tech that allows for near seamless transitions from ground to space. There are multiple layers to consider, and while some details will make your journey feel more genuine, there are flaws that occasionally derail your investment in the odyssey. However, there's an intriguing narrative that contextualizes your in-game actions, making for a fascinating experience that ultimately trumps issues that appear early on. Like the location and composition of each planet, most of the things you see and interact with in No Man's Sky have been arranged by an algorithm. You may find joy in identifying and cataloging new plant and animal species, of which there are plenty. The sheer number of possible variations of worlds and wild species is too large to fully comprehend, but because the variety is defined by a computer pulling from a restricted pool of options, animals appear more like slapdash creations than thoughtful constructions. No matter how immediately strange and amusing your first dozen encounters with nature are, these sightings start to feel rote after only a few hours because every living thing is weird in one way or another. They can't all be special. If biology isn't your bag, you can spend your days mining planets for resources that you can sell to other traders in space stations, mix to craft simple goods and accessories, or store as fuel reserves for your gear and starship. With your gun-like mining tool, you’ll spend hours tearing through rocks, plants, and asteroids in search of commodities. As is the case with wildlife, planets aren't guaranteed to have what you're looking for--some are barren, others offer untold bounties, and the rest fall somewhere in the middle. As you explore, you have to monitor your exosuit equipment to maintain protection from hazardous conditions--and, occasionally, to recover from a violent encounter. Combat is a secondary activity, but it occurs often enough to make the game's unrefined controls a bigger issue. As you mine planets, security drones belonging to an unknown entity will attack if you’re too brazen or greedy. Aiming the weapon component of your multitool is finicky enough to make these encounters more of an annoyance than an enjoyable challenge. In space, you may cross paths with space pirates--usually one or a group of three. These battles, again, lack excitement and depth. Unlike planets, which often feel plausible and unpredictable, NPCs you meet in space stations and outposts lack distinct personalities. They are siloed in repetitive and predictable structures, existing solely to serve as the other party during an exchange of words and goods. At best, you can learn bits of each species' lexicon by discovering translation monoliths on planets, but even this process lacks substance. While it can be somewhat gratifying to see previously garbled speech slowly turn into recognizable words over dozens of hours, trader dialogue remains stiff and impersonal, only pertaining to the events at hand. Even when you fail to understand what another being is saying, your character's inner dialogue paints a clear picture of the situation, allowing you to easily make logical, lucrative decisions. Your starship and exosuit have a limited number of slots that can hold stacks of resources or be used to apply equipment upgrades. You gain new slots for your exosuit and have the option to purchase new starships with greater storage capacity, but no matter how many slots you have, you'll always crave more. So you try to be efficient and work with what you have, but No Man's Sky doesn't make it easy. You have to navigate a plain grid of items using a slow-moving cursor, holding down a button for seconds at a time to confirm every action. Managing your inventory is a large part of No Man's Sky, and it's made more difficult than it needs to be. Starships come in a range of models, with varying color palettes and accessories, and while you may get lucky and find a wrecked ship to repair and call your own, working models are readily available in space-station hangars, where traders come and go in real time. The wait-and-see approach to ship shopping can be a tad boring, but when one you love coasts into view and you can afford it, you feel rejuvenated. When you have a fresh new ride, it doesn't feel like your efforts planetside were in vain--they’re the reason you can afford an upgrade. No matter how many solar systems you jump to or planets you explore on the ""direct"" path to the center of the galaxy, you'll grow tired of repetitive NPC interactions and the planets' implied-but-shallow variety, and you’ll lose interest in new ships--and perhaps the journey altogether. As time goes on, however, you may lose the high that came from your new purchase and seek another. No Man's Sky pitches material pursuits as its reason for being in that all of its systems are in support of making big money to afford big purchases, but the loop eventually wears thin, and you grow increasingly immune to the thrill of purchasing new toys. Even envy creeps in when a fancy ship passes you by, which often leads to begrudgingly mining on any planet with the goods, regardless of how depressing or empty it may be. In a galaxy with no real friends or social ties, it's easy to look at possessions as a way to curb loneliness and provide meaning to your journey. You're given little direction other than to try to get to the center of the galaxy. When you begin nearly 180,000 light-years away from the center and each black hole carries you, on average, about 1,000 light-years forward, it's tough to feel like you're making progress. No matter how many solar systems you jump to or planets you explore on the ""direct"" path to the center of the galaxy, you'll grow tired of repetitive NPC interactions and the planets' implied-but-shallow variety, and you’ll lose interest in new ships--and perhaps the journey altogether. However, there is another way to play No Man's Sky that skirts open-ended meandering. Tucked neatly into the galaxy is a narrative path, delivered so subtly that you may miss the fact that the first decision you make in the game--activating a distress beacon--connects you to a mysterious force known as Atlas. As you continue to travel the stars, you encounter peculiar space stations housing two scientists. These individuals help you acquire equipment upgrades and can point you toward black holes or illuminate the path to Atlas stations. Atlas stations are vast, temple-like spaces with an altar that allows you to convene with the spirit of Atlas. At first, it's difficult to define what Atlas is, but if you continue to heed its call, it will open your eyes to greater truths about itself, your journey, and the galaxy at large. In a game with such a seemingly loose structure, Atlas is a godsend, providing direction and perspective that’s otherwise lost if you simply head to the center of the galaxy on the default path outlined on your star map. The realizations that Atlas stirs in your character's mind address big-picture questions pertaining to not only the game, but also to life itself. You’re forced to confront the point of your wandering, the value of material wealth, and the reason for existence. Atlas, in many ways, illustrates the value religion plays in some people's lives, but it also--quite cleverly--examines the role a game like No Man's Sky plays. It's no small coincidence that the scientist who aids you in your quest to find Atlas bemoans your direction, yet is hungry to consume what you discover. If you only concern yourself with exploring, mining, and buying goods, you may burn out on No Man's Sky early. Atlas' observations regarding these pursuits are apt, but even if you recognize these activities as shallow, they could be better with added depth and improved mechanics. No amount of clever, thoughtful writing can excuse these issues. That said, the way Atlas frames these activities and how it makes you consider them in life as well as in-game--that's redeeming. No Man's Sky is immediately a massive game with impressive seamless transitions from ground to space, and it will entertain your inner collector for a while. The more you get to know it, the more you recognize its faults, and it's easy to fall so deep into the act of exploring and trading that your focus narrows to those aspects alone. If, however, you consider everything it has to offer and listen to what Atlas has to say, No Man's Sky becomes more than a collection of slightly different worlds in a seemingly never-ending galaxy--it becomes an examination of the meaning of life in a way that's more valuable than all the gold or starships in its virtual galaxy.

78,Justin Clark,Everyone 10+,7,Bound,"Aug 16, 2016"," The first impression you get of Bound is that of a platforming video game that uses interpretive dance as a foundation for all movement. It's only after the credits roll that you realize the reverse is true: Bound is an interactive, interpretive dance about a video game. Bound speaks the language of games, but it’s only vaguely interested in fluency. It reproduces the basic elements in grand, abstract, poetic flourishes. Even the simple act of pressing the jump button creates a symphony of balletic movements from our brave heroine. Bound is less focused on presenting a series of challenges than it is in letting players participate in an interactive modern-dance performance. The story of this particular libretto? A princess is tasked by her mother, the queen, to slay a giant monster that threatens to corrupt and destroy their kingdom. You must traverse the massive labyrinth that is their kingdom, tracking the beast at every turn until you get close enough to use your powers to undo its influence. Bound's gameplay is rudimentary, consisting primarily of running, jumping across moving platforms, and climbing ladders. Most of what passes for challenge has to do with navigating the many alternate routes through the labyrinth, sussing out what's actually going to get you down to a lower level safely, what's an actual shortcut, and what may result in plunging to your doom. But like Journey before it, the devil is in the details. Each stage is a cubist marvel, where every single element feels like it's forged from living, shattered stained glass. The game works wonders with this aesthetic, going from alien, gravity-defying architecture stretching into the stratosphere to vast, beautiful seas that roll out in waves for miles. Repetitive as these actions can sometimes be, the game still deserves praise for creating a protagonist who neither looks nor moves like any other video game character: a lithe, masked hero whose smallest motion is an act of grace. Then there's the princess herself--our heroic dancer who must travel the labyrinth. There isn't much to her from a mechanical standpoint. She can run and jump, and in lieu of an attack, she can perform an elaborate dance that allows her to traipse through dangerous environments unscathed. It's a wonderful idea, albeit somewhat undercooked. You can put some variations on the dance with simple button combinations, but doing so doesn't serve a meaningful purpose. Repetitive as these actions can sometimes be, the game still deserves praise for creating a protagonist who neither looks nor moves like any other video game character: a lithe, masked hero whose smallest motion is an act of grace. Like all interpretive dance, this is all a metaphor for something much more cerebral, presented through the frame of scenes set in the real world--adding the right amount of context to make parsing your journey insightful and rewarding. The ultimate meaning of Bound's tale relies on your own perspective, but there's a subtle-yet-undeniable emotional weight from beginning to end. Bound is a game that displays immense amounts of contemplation and ambition in every aspect except gameplay. And yet, to decry it for its overly simplistic mechanics is to ultimately miss the forest for the trees. Bound is digital art installation. It's only in the game's final moments, when you're able to view the full breadth of the work, that it's clear this is a work of art that could not be accomplished in any other medium but this one.",Bound is a 3D platformer designed for people with the desire to concentrate on the narrative side of games and experience a mature story.,4.5
79,Mat Paget,,8,Deus Ex GO,"Aug 18, 2016"," Puzzle games and stealth adventures share many similarities. To succeed at both, you need to be smart, cunning, and calculated. You need to plan your moves several steps ahead, and you need to know exactly how everything around you is going to react. Sometimes you get lucky and fall headfirst into an unlikely solution. And both can empower you in ways that don't require you to pull a trigger and kill. Deus Ex Go excels at empowering players through the act of smart planning, and it doesn't let up until you've cleaned out every available puzzle. Deus Ex Go is the newest entry in Square Enix's Go series, which converts franchises like Hitman and Tomb Raider into puzzle games. In Deus Ex Go, you control series protagonist Adam Jensen like you would a chess piece, moving around a board-like area, taking out enemies and slipping out of their paths. Each level requires you to get to the exit, while myriad obstacles--such as turrets, robots, and blocked paths--prevent you from heading directly to it. Many of the roadblocks require you to hack your way past them by visiting a terminal and drawing a path between it and the object you want to manipulate. Solving Deus Ex Go's puzzles is incredibly satisfying. Never did I feel like one was something I had to brute force with trial-and-error to figure out. It's enjoyable to look at the game's puzzles and figure out what you can do to make your way through their hazards. Some solutions appropriately make you feel like a hacker, as though you’re tricking the game into letting you move on to the next level. It's hugely rewarding when you utilize an enemy to get past an obstacle, such as hiding behind it for cover or using it to deactivate terminals that grant access to new sections of the level. When it comes to visuals, Deus Ex Go isn't quite as colorful or vibrant as its Go predecessors (Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go), opting instead for a starker, cleaner, more futuristic look. Additionally, it's the first game in the Go series to attempt a narrative. The story is set over the course of a single mission, where Jensen must save a person of some importance. However, things quickly spin out of control, forcing Jensen to solve a lot more puzzles than he initially thought he’d have to. While the story is given little attention and fails to capture your imagination, thankfully, the puzzles are more than enough to keep you moving forward until the credits roll. In addition to the story, Deus Ex Go offers weekly sets of new puzzles that consist of five levels. Unfortunately, by the time I was done with the story and had moved on to the puzzles of the week, I wanted more than what the standard 54 levels offered. Hitman Go presents multiple objectives in each level, which encourages players to return for an additional challenge. Deus Ex Go only offers a single challenge for each level, and it's the same one every time: complete the puzzle in a certain number of steps. This offers some replayability, but it's not the most exciting reason to give a level another shot. By the time I was done with the story and had moved on to the puzzles of the week, I wanted more than what the standard 54 levels offered. Deus Ex Go offers microtransactions, and unfortunately, it asks you to pay for the solutions to puzzles. You should be able to learn how to get through a puzzle by observing what everything in the level does and reacts to, and using one of these paid-for solutions cheats you of the knowledge that makes Deus Ex Go special. Additionally, the microtransactions are priced in a way that encourages you to spend the most money possible. Two solutions cost nearly $3, while $10 will get you 25. With only 54 levels in the story, it would effectively ruin half the game to buy the $10 package. For such an incredible puzzle game, it's disappointing to see it tarnished with the option to pay your way through it. Despite its few faults, Deus Ex Go remains an increasingly fun, rewarding puzzle-solving experience. It continues the Go series' streak of excellence and leaves me longing to know what developer Square Enix Montreal will do next with the franchise. Whatever it happens to be, if it's done with the same thoughtfulness that makes Deus Ex Go such a compelling puzzle experience, it'll be well worth playing.

80,Edmond Tran,Mature,8,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided,"Aug 23, 2016"," The way I play Deus Ex: Mankind Divided may not be the same way you play it. When I step into the shoes of Adam Jensen, I avoid conflict, drink all the alcohol I find, and stop bad guys from doing terrible things by releasing pheromones into the air and then asking politely. I like to sneak through areas without hurting anyone if possible, and prefer to knock someone out and hide their body if I really need them out of the way. But occasionally, I want to role-play a cyberpunk bad-ass who doesn't take trash from anybody, letting my magnum revolver do the talking when I enter a room. Deus Ex lets me do all these things, and doesn't punish me for solving problems one way over another. The series is characteristically defined by giving you choices--a variety of ways to tackle given situations like armed conflict, social interactions, and branches in storyline. Mankind Divided is no different. There is no wrong way to play, and the game rewards you for achieving things with your personally preferred method, no matter what that may involve. Every obstacle in the cyberpunk world of Mankind Divided has multiple solutions, provided you've invested in certain abilities. For conflict scenarios, there are more than enough tools provided for a direct approach--a variety of lethal and non-lethal guns, grenades and ammo which fire and explode wonderfully, and cybernetic augmentations that can give you temporary buffs like heavy armor or slowing down time. Shooting controls well--it feels effortless to transition from first-person aiming into third-person cover mechanics, change ammo types quickly, and smoothly line up headshots with iron sights. Entering a room while firing a shotgun, then finishing off the last couple of enemies with a lethal takedown feels exceptional. Alternatively, there are robust stealth mechanics that let you slip quickly and accurately from cover to cover, see enemy sightlines, and let you turn temporarily invisible. If enemies hear or see you they'll transition into a suspicious state where they will attempt to confirm your presence before turning hostile, and this can be used to your advantage. Throwing objects or intentionally making a noise can lure a guard to a particular area, letting you silently take them out or slip past them unnoticed. You can also use hacking skills and have fun taking advantage of the game’s futuristic setting, turning sentry robots, automated turrets, and the environment against aggressors without drawing attention to Jensen himself. But no matter how you decide to go about solving a problem, there is always a thrill when you succeed, and the game dishes out experience points no matter which actions you take. This means killing enemies is just as satisfying as slipping past them without raising suspicion. Punching through a wall is as fulfilling as stealing a keycard and just using the door. There is no superior way to complete a task. Killing enemies is just as satisfying as slipping past them without raising suspicion. Punching through a wall is as fulfilling as stealing a keycard and just using the door. During investigation scenarios, the direct approach may require you to manually hack into computer terminals in order to procure the information you need, or craft tools to do the hacking for you. If you have the patience though, coercing knowledge out of a citizen or spending time snooping around for clues can also provide what you need. It's refreshing to play a game where different routes can not only be equally successful, but flexible as well. Being an expert in one field doesn't necessarily lock you out of another. Mankind Divided introduces a handful of new augmentation abilities for Jensen on top of those introduced in the previous game, Human Revolution. Some of these new augs are more interesting than others though; Remote Hacking is invaluable for disabling automated obstacles at a distance, and Icarus Dash is a powerful tool for discreet traversal. However the TESLA, PEPS, and Nanoblade abilities achieve similar effects to some of the game's more conventional weapons--they stun and kill enemies from a distance. There are some advantages to using them, but most of the time I wished I had spent points elsewhere. What's interesting about these new abilities is that with their introduction comes with a caveat: to equip them, players must disable one of their other augmentations to avoid putting strain on Jensen’s predominantly cybernetic body, and risking negative effects. Initially, this ""Overclocking"" system makes for tantalizing dilemmas. The necessity of permanently disabling some skills in order to power others early in the campaign made me stop and seriously think about how I would be handling situations in the future. Not all augments can be disabled (you can’t disable your HUD, for instance) but when I decided to enable Remote Hacking, I made the tough decision to disable something seemingly essential--the ability to mark and track enemies. However, as I earned more skill points I decided to experiment, activating multiple new abilities at once without disabling others. The unfortunate revelation was that despite characters and the augmentation menu telling me I was at a critical status and needed to disable more abilities, I experienced no serious detrimental effects that made completing missions any more difficult than usual--a brief radar glitch was the worst I saw. Even more annoyingly, a later plot event re-enabled my once permanently disabled talents. Although being able to unlock and use all abilities in a single playthrough of Deus Ex is near impossible, it was disappointing to see a consequential, weighty choice made inconsequential. Mankind Divided continues with the series' portrayal of a cyberpunk dystopia with a focus on the politics around people with cybernetic implants, and the subsequent implications on the definitions of humanity. The plot involves countless government bodies, corporations, security forces, underground resistances, even the Illuminati--and the events of Mankind Divided frame suspicion on literally every organisation and individual it introduces. This makes it impossible to trust any one character other than Jensen as you search for evidence revealing the motives and masterminds behind a number of terrorist acts. Deciding which organisation to aid and which to deceive during pivotal plot moments is grueling because everything is so unyieldingly grey. The world and attitudes of characters can vary depending on your choices and actions, and even the game's dozen or so side missions take dramatic twists and press you to make difficult decisions--many involve the ethics of hypotheticals our present-day society has yet to encounter--and there are no right answers. It's easy to become completely engrossed in this morally ambiguous chess game, with so many unknown factors lurking beneath the surface. But the lack of a clear antagonist or driving purpose at any one time can lead to temporary disillusionment, with no one enemy ever standing in the metaphorical crosshairs for too long. The upside to this is that Mankind Divided doesn't feature the ill-received boss battles that appeared in Human Revolution, and remains purely as a series of increasingly challenging infiltration and investigation scenarios, all of which can be solved in the manner of your choosing. The pace of the game doesn't feel like one that's defined by a series of climactic acts, but a constant burn of tension and a chase for knowledge as mainline missions, hub exploration, and optional side missions bleed into one another. The world of Deus Ex is an easy one to get completely absorbed in. The city hubs, all based in Prague, are where you'll spend most of your time and are stunningly well-realised. The streets are full of life and bold neon advertising. The futuristic buildings constructed among old-world European architecture and dilapidated housing make the city believable. You'll revisit locations and walk the same routes regularly in Mankind Divided, gaining an intimate knowledge of the streets and structures, and this knowledge is incredibly useful and satisfying to draw upon as new situations arise. One hub, Útulek Station, is a stunningly claustrophobic and oppressive multi-level slum, filled with ramshackle apartments and dense marketplaces which made me stop every few feet just to soak it all in.   Exploring these environments for information and scavenging for items is also immensely enjoyable. Spaces are filled with character, densely packed with discoveries to make about its inhabitants, and are exceptionally curated with subtlety. You might push unremarkable boxes on a shelf aside to pleasantly discover someone has hidden some rainy day cash behind them. You might look behind someone's couch to find that's where they stash a pistol, just in case. You may notice that despite his constant, over-the-top broody demeanor, Adam Jensen absolutely loves eating colorful, sugary cereal. Additionally, a portion of the game’s side missions are not explicitly marked, and only found by going out of your way to talk to certain people you may have otherwise run past. Mankind Divided rewards exploration, and its locations are delightful to explore. Mankind Divided rewards exploration, and its locations are delightful to explore. Mankind Divided also includes an asymmetrical online-only competitive mode called Breach. Breach uses the first-person combat, stealth and remote hacking mechanics of Deus Ex in brief, visually abstracted challenge missions with a focus on score-chasing, speedrunning, and beating other players. Augmentation abilities are also present, but Breach uses a slightly modified skill tree, and enforces stricter limitations--the player is able to unlock every upgrade, but they can only equip a limited number before going into each mission. The tone of Breach is very different to the main campaign, with the emphasis not so much on the breadth of options available to you, but taking the path of least resistance. After playing through Adam Jensen's story as a Pacifist, Breach gave me much more license to experiment without consequence--racing around like a maniac, shooting non-human enemies and causing general chaos as I tried to climb the speedrun leaderboard. Breach mode also incorporates a career levelling system, similar to other multiplayer games, where you can earn ""Booster Packs"" containing randomised items like weapons, special ammo, one-time buffs and skill points to aid progress. I found this inclusion to be a little off-putting here, since one of Breach's draw cards for me was its skill-based leaderboards, and your performance can be significantly helped or hindered depending on what random drops you do or don't receive. Although multiplayer-focused, Breach also attempts to tie directly into the Deus Ex universe. As you progress, new conspiracy stories arise and unlocking their details requires you to successfully collect a number of gems in particular missions. These are interesting to take in, but feel out of place within Breach. I would've rather uncovered these dark mysteries in the main game, rather than collecting gems and punching bright neon men in the face in an optional mode. Tonal confusion aside, Breach is still a pleasing way to hone your skills with Deus Ex's action mechanics. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided refines and reinforces the defining foundations of the series. It creates challenging situations and gives players the tools and flexibility to deal with them in a multitude of ways, all within an absorbing cyberpunk world. Although not a significant departure from Human Revolution, Mankind Divided is still a uniquely fulfilling experience, one which feels rare in games today.","Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is an action role-playing game that takes place in 2029, two years after the events of Human Revolution and the infamous ‘Aug Incident’ in Panchaea that resulted in the death of millions at the hands of those who had installed augmentations.",7.2
81,Matt Espineli,Teen,8,The King of Fighters XIV,"Aug 23, 2016"," The King of Fighters XIV is yet another satisfying entry in the long-running KOF series. It ditches the intricate sprites found in recent games in the series in favor of 3D characters and backgrounds, though battles still take place on a 2D plane. This change is bound to turn off those who might favor the series' traditional visual style; however, the game's core fighting system lives up to the series’ legacy, offering new mechanics that expand upon those from its predecessor. KOF 14 is an engrossing fighter that exceeds the initial impressions of its bland presentation, delivering an experience well worth your time, whether you're a dedicated KOF follower or a casual fighting game fan. KOF 14 pits your side against teams of three fighters in a series of one-on-one battles; when one character is defeated, the next one is brought into battle and a new round begins. Returning players will notice the difference in movement speed from past games right away; the game seemingly slows down the energetic action of KOF 13, but this doesn't diminish the exciting nature of fights. Battles remain tense and exhilarating, especially once you get a feel for the pace of combat and combo timing. Many familiar faces from the series’ 22-year history return, while a host of new characters enter the fray to mix up the series' already diverse set of fighting styles. It’s uplifting to see such a robust cast, but it’s unfortunate that the visuals do little to bring their large personalities to life. The new 3D character models, while serviceable, are stiffly animated and occasionally doll-like in appearance. They’re a far cry from the dynamic 2D sprites of the past, showcasing only a faint glimmer of what made these characters so memorable and endearing. Despite the less-than-stellar visuals, KOF 14’s new fighting system is its most striking quality. It streamlines mechanics we’ve seen in the past, while introducing expansive techniques and options for combos. The result is a fighting system that's easier to understand and more fulfilling to engage with. The game presents three major mechanics to manage: Max Mode, Super/Advanced/Climax Cancels, and Rush. Max Mode is a cross between KOF 13's EX Specials and Hyperdrive Mode--it’s a state you trigger that grants you the ability to perform more powerful versions of your character’s special moves. These prove useful in turning the tide of battle, since these beefed-up moves can be linked with other moves to create even more powerful combos. Max Mode can be activated whenever you have a super meter to spare. Then there’s the multiple ways of canceling moves into supers, which is the game’s bread and butter for executing destructive combos. Each allows you to cancel a certain move into a type of super special move at the cost of a set amount of super meter. When executed properly, canceling can be an effective means of finishing off opponents when you’re in a tight spot. It’s also an especially user-friendly mechanic that’s far easier to execute than the complicated Drive Cancels from KOF 13. Canceling out of one attack and beginning another more powerful one allows you to turn a single move into a custom combo, and with three ways to cancel moves in KOF 14, this opens up a wealth of opportunities for players of all skill levels to deliver a series of devastating attacks. Lastly, Rush is a unique combo that you can perform by repeatedly pressing light punch. Similar to Persona 4 Arena’s auto combo, the attack is suited for beginners looking for a way to strike back at their opponent. This may raise red flags for advanced players; however, the attack is balanced accordingly, requiring you to be right next to an opponent in order to perform it. Rush also does comparatively little damage when you stack it up against the game's powerful combos. These new mechanics help make KOF 14's combo-focused fighting system less convoluted and more straightforward; it’s the most accessible entry in the series thus far. That isn't to say that it downplays the finesse and strategic planning of the game. You’re still required to understand the fundamentals of execution and positioning if you want to be able to fully take advantage of the offensive and defensive capabilities available. The coalescing of these mechanics makes performing devastating combos easier, which increases the stakes of a fight--one wrong move could result in a punishing reprisal that costs you half your life bar. However, the odds are tipped in your favor the more of your team’s roster is eliminated since the game provides additional super meter bars on top of your base ones during consecutive lost rounds. You may end up with five super meter bars during the final round of a match, which can be a lifesaver if you're able to find an opening to initiate a comeback. While this might seem imbalanced at first, it gives the losing player opportunity to even the odds, so that by the time the match reaches its final round, both sides are on equal footing. Still, it’s unfortunate that a combo-breaker move (in the vein of Guilty Gear’s Burst mechanic) wasn’t implemented to better give newcomers a chance to stave off opponents with higher combo literacy. Thankfully, the path to understanding the intricacies of KOF 14 is a welcoming one, since the game offers a multitude of tutorials to get you up to speed on the series’ established mechanics, such as rolls, blowbacks, and the all the different types of jumps. There’s also a Trial mode that educates you on the combos you can perform with each character, providing a general idea of which attacks and special moves each character can link together. Once you’ve outfitted yourself with the basic knowledge to fight, KOF 14 offers plenty of modes in which to test your skills. Like past games, there's a story mode that allows you to fight against 10 stages’ worth of CPU opponents, but if you're expecting anything similar to the recent story modes from other fighters, like Street Fighter V or Mortal Kombat X, you're going to be disappointed. The narrative is vague and nearly non-existent, setting up--in three brief cutscenes--a much larger conflict that's likely to continue in later installments. Fortunately, the game includes ending cutscenes for each of the canonical teams to help bookend your journey and provide slight context over the events that took place. If you're looking to compete against other players online, the good news is that servers are smooth and stable thus far. It also helps that your online activities are initiated via matchmaking rooms, where up to 12 players can join in and slot into separate rooms within to play exhibition matches of a chosen mode. The format is intuitive and keeps you from having to constantly search for a new room after every match just to find another opponent--though you'll be resorting to this in Ranked mode. It's also a great way to interact with multiple players at once via voice chat or text, testing your skills, asking questions, or discussing strategies. With plenty of opportunities available online or off, KOF 14 is a well-executed addition to the revered fighting series. Those disappointed in its new visuals may be unwilling to give it a chance, but if you remain steadfast in parsing through the multiple layers of its mechanics, you'll be rewarded with one of the most accessible, satisfying entries in the series to date.","KOF returns in a brand new installment, The King of Fighters XIV, on PlayStation®4",8
82,Peter Brown,Teen,5,Metroid Prime: Federation Force,"Aug 19, 2016"," Metroid Prime: Federation Force is the first Metroid game in more than half a decade, coming hot on the heels of the series' 30th anniversary. Rather than walk in the footsteps of its forebears and thrust you into another adventure as spacefaring bounty hunter Samus Aran, Federation Force puts you in the boots of a no-name foot soldier and tasks you to complete nearly two-dozen short missions. You can play alone--using an item that boosts your strength to help even the odds--but you're highly encouraged to team up with other players locally or online. Even though it bears the title of the renowned franchise, Federation Force is only tenuously connected to the Metroid universe, with its only strong links to the series being a few cameos and references. But it's the inconsistent gameplay and difficulty spikes that make it tough to love, rather than the tenuous connection to its beloved namesake. First and foremost, this is a first-person shooter where you spend a lot of time fighting armed ground troops, flying pirates, and occasional space bugs. Moving and aiming work surprisingly well, and uses a combination of the 3DS analog stick and gyroscopic sensors. With a New 3DS system, you can use the secondary stick to control the camera for more traditional, console-like controls. Save for your modest walking and turning speed, Federation Force's mechanics are sound and work as expected from the get-go. Rather than build up an array of powerful weapons as you progress into the campaign, you have access to a slew of weaponry practically from the start, including missiles, elemental ammo, proximity mines, and decoys. You pick and choose your loadout from ammo reserves prior to each mission, but you can pick up replenishments from item boxes within levels, regardless of your initial selection. For the most part, you succeed by shooting what you can with whatever you've got, and if an ally falls, you can revive them by rapidly tapping a button next to their mech. In multiplayer, everyone in your party pulls from the same ammo pool before heading into battle. With no voice chat online, you're left to communicate via impersonal, predefined text strings if you want to strategize loadouts with your team. You can see how breaking up offensive and recovery items pre-mission could facilitate forming roles within your squad, but missions fail to incentivize such behavior. For the most part, you succeed by shooting what you can with whatever you've got, and if an ally falls, you can revive them by rapidly tapping a button next to their mech. Missions offer little in the way of exploration, with secondary objectives that feed into your score serving as the primary incentive to think outside of the box. Even here, Federation Force loses its head, since there comes a point during multiple missions where you aren't rewarded points for shooting enemies due to an imposed score limit. You can look for cracked walls and bust them open to discover equippable mods that slightly enhance your stats, but you end up with so many middling mods that they begin to feel like an afterthought only a few missions in. A few are helpful in a pinch, but most offer incremental, almost-indiscernible boosts. It doesn't take long before going the extra mile becomes an afterthought. Simple puzzle-based missions, by and large, fail to match the occasional excitement of combat, but they break up the predictable stream of alien grunts nonetheless. These mini-challenges typically involve shooting balls with your gun to roll them from one end of a map to another, navigating around obstacles and incoming fire along the way. But there comes a point in one mission where you pick up a ball using your suit's tractor beam, and you wonder why you were forced to deal with the convoluted process of shooting the balls to and fro in the first place. It's a minor contradiction, but one that feeds into the game's overarching sense of disarray. Though you spend most of your time suited up in a mech, you occasionally need to abandon it to sneak into tight spaces and flip an access switch. You’re unarmed and diminutive compared to the space pirates that stand in your way, and Federation Force forces you to play stealthily during these sections--benign diversions that neither thrill nor pose a meaningful challenge. Federation Force doesn't shine as a single-player experience because mission parameters and variables are balanced for larger parties and remain set in stone regardless of your party size. There are times, however, when the game is too difficult or too easy for its own good; it all depends on the size of your squad. As I reported last week, Federation Force doesn't shine as a single-player experience because mission parameters and variables are balanced for larger parties and remain set in stone regardless of your party size. I hit a wall about a third of the way through the game when playing alone and eventually teamed up with a coworker. Together, we progressed further in the campaign but found ourselves outgunned with only a few missions left. I was able to team up with a full squad (four players) this past weekend, and sure enough, we completed the final few missions without fail. It should’ve been cause for celebration, but victory came almost too easy. A boss that a team of two couldn't finish in 20 minutes was effortlessly pummeled into submission in less than five minutes with a full team. I spent more time with the game after finishing the campaign, tackling missions with teams of two, three, and four players, and concluded that there's no perfect fit for Federation Force as a whole. Playing by yourself the entire time is too difficult to be fun during certain missions--your punishment for failure is having to restart the entire mission--but playing with a full squad makes even the game's toughest encounters too easy to appreciate. In a game with discrete modes for playing solo or with a team, it's reasonable to expect that the game would cater its difficulty levels accordingly. Save for an item that boosts your damage output and armor, you're granted no meaningful advantage when playing alone. Even if you get a stat boost when playing solo, you can't be in two, let alone four places at once, and you can't repeatedly revive yourself when you run out of health. Federation Force is lopsided; it presents simple rules and scenarios, but the variables therein fluctuate with no discernible rhyme and reason. If you manage to somehow land in a mission with the appropriate number of people, boss fights in particular can feel exciting, but you shouldn't be penalized for playing with a squad of any size when the game casually allows it. You can take the time to seek out a team whose size meets your needs, but that's bending over backward to accomplish something that should be handled for you. Unless you know missions like the back of your hand, you may find yourself unsure of how big that team should be in the first place. When you strike the right balance between a mission and the size of your party, Federation Force is a decent co-op shooter with standout controls that provides a few hours of enjoyment. Unfortunately, it can just as easily frustrate you or bore you for no reason other than its static difficulty. Metroid devotees may not find a game that aligns with their deepest desires, but that alone isn't cause for concern here. In fact, Samus groupies may be thrilled to know that a post-credits sequence appears to hint at a new chapter in the Prime saga. This tip of the hat may inspire warm and fuzzy feelings for a moment, but an implied announcement for a game people have been asking for doesn't wash away the bad taste of a game that nobody wanted. Expectations for Metroid aside, Federation Force fails to make a case for itself in the end. And then there's Blast Ball: the soccer-like game where you and two other players face off in matches against bots or other players, shooting a massive ball with your gun in hopes of knocking it into your opponent's goal. Blast Ball is nothing short of a chaotic frenzy where everyone fires at the ball simultaneously, aching for total control but never achieving it. More than a sport, Blast Ball is a war of attrition. Your controls work just as well as the main game, but there's almost zero room for skill or nuanced play. Having more to do in a game for the sake of having options isn't an automatic victory. If anything, Blast Ball is an unnecessary reminder of how mediocre Federation Force is as a whole.  ","Join a four-player local or online squad in this co-operative sci-fi shooter set in the Metroid universe. Hop in a specialized battle Mech suit and work with your teammates to take down enemy forces and complete objective- based missions. Then, take a break and play a fun, pick-up game of Blast

83,Miguel Concepcion,Everyone,8,Madden NFL 17,"Aug 23, 2016"," Madden games have historically had many different difficulty settings and challenges, but Madden NFL 17 actually gives you the confidence and the desire to take them on. Between an improved running game and welcome changes to the defensive line, EA Sports’ latest iteration of its lauded football series not only provides more tools to become a well-rounded playmaker but also the means to execute more decisive plays. A significant launch-week bug and lack of online co-op are just two of the issues that prevent it from being a complete Madden experience, but that doesn’t hold back Madden 17 from making you feel like a complete Madden player. After two years of superb entries in the series, Madden 17 capitalizes on those most recent games’ strengths. Last year’s passing improvements are now complemented by improved animations in an already solid running game. The juke, for example, looks and feels more like a highlight-ready move. Against teams with high defensive ratings, pulling off a tactful juke feels like a reward for adept spatial awareness. Madden 17 adds a number of different animations, with the most graceful jukes reserved for the most agile players. Even if the Jets’ Eric Decker has a plus-80 overall rating, his sub-80 juke stats makes him a slightly less graceful wide receiver than say, Odell Beckham Jr.. It’s fitting that Madden 17’s main menu gives equal real estate to its two marquee modes. Franchise has been a Madden institution since the late 1990s, and Ultimate Team (and, to an extent, Draft Champions) satisfies that card-collecting itch while allowing you to live out the fantasy of building a squad of promising rookies, Hall of Famers, and other talented players. Franchise remains the trusty single-player campaign that lets you show devotion to a team over multiple seasons. The roster UI has been improved over last year’s unremarkable interface, which now features prompts for roster cutdowns and recommendations on who to trade, cut, and sign. This saves considerable time while you make key week-to-week adjustments. The main draw, whether you’re in this mode as a player or owner, is in seeing the impact of your decisions over the course of a season, whether it’s key trades or changes to concession prices. There’s a sense of responsibility with every choice, like how you address lingering injuries. If you’re an Andrew Luck devotee taking control of the Indianapolis Colts, would you start him even if he’s not in peak condition? Would you risk a season-ending injury just because you’re not comfortable with the backup talents of Scott Tolzien? Even though Ultimate Team hasn’t been around as long as Franchise, it has a well-earned following, despite its microtransactions. Of course, you can have a completely satisfying experience grinding it out through the mode’s solo challenges without spending a dime. Completing these tasks serves multiple purposes: You feel a sense of accomplishment in overcoming developer-curated obstacles, you’re strengthening your roster with newly acquired cards, and you’re getting practical training that carries over to all other modes. A skilled defender knows how to read the subtle clues of an opponent’s formation in order to get an edge on the offense. Unfortunately, a noteworthy bug (which originated in the pre-launch EA Access build) gives the defense too much information--specifically on whether or not they can expect a passing or running play. It’s simply a matter of whether you can see the receiver’s names or not. If the names are visible while toggling the Play Art feature, it’s a pass; if not, it’s a running play. One hopes that developer EA Tiburon will have a patch to address this soon. While not as detrimental, long loading times hamper select areas, particularly the Ultimate Team solo challenges. If there’s meaningful solace to be found, it’s in the ability to (finally!) skip cinematics and other non-gameplay camera cutaways. Madden 17 greatly benefits from these little tweaks and touches. There’s added realism in player locomotion, even for linemen who aren’t handling the ball. Midair swatting by a defender is a fitting counter to an otherwise overpowering receiving game. And it’s a challenge finding copy-and-pasted groups of fans in the crowd. One of the more obvious changes involves kickoffs and field goals. By employing a three-button input system used by most golf games, EA Tiburon shows its willingness to use tried-and-true mechanics that have been around since the 1980s. This is a franchise that evolves over years--and, in recent entries, over days. Weekly roster updates have become a series standard, the kind of perk that fans look forward to regularly. Trades by the Week 8 deadline seldom ever change the overall strengths and weaknesses of a given roster, but it’s always an engaging experiment to be on the opposing side and see how these new lineup changes can shape the playoff picture or even your weekly heated matches against friends. The Seattle Seahawks are a particularly intriguing team even before the regular season starts, given the retirement of likely Hall of Fame tailback Marshawn Lynch. Madden 17 impresses as an ever-evolving product, with sponsored updates and promotions and a non-intrusive ticker that shows recent scores, upcoming matchups, and news from around the league. Even with speedy game flow and the lack of commercial breaks, a game in Madden can last anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour if you’re a purist who plays 15 minute quarters. EA Tiburon’s idea of an alternative play session for busy people is called Play the Moments. This mode significantly reduces play times by having the bulk of the game unfold via a simulation while letting you take control on crucial plays. It pits you against two opponents: the AI and the simulation itself. It’s a dicey proposition to leave the outcome of an entire drive in the hands of the CPU, but after several tests against unbalanced teams, it’s comforting that even lowly teams like the Jets consistently have a chance at beating the Patriots at the half. Beyond the highly accessible Rookie and Pro modes, Skills Trainer ensures that newcomers and novices receive a thorough understanding of the controls. It’s a lot to take in, which is why Madden 17 retains the series’ context-sensitive button hints. The only missing feature is a submenu detailing the rules of football--the kind of details that would benefit a genuine newcomer. However, time and practice are your best tools in going up against players who’ve played Madden for decades. It’s not hard to put up a fight, even if you lose your first dozen online matches. First-time Madden commentators Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis aren’t household names, but their professional experience at Westwood One and Fox Sports respectively makes them qualified to fill in these coveted roles previously held by the likes of Jim Nantz and Cris Collinsworth. It only takes one quarter to get a feel for their talent and enthusiasm for the sport. Their contributions game after game are more than serviceable, though their accounts aren’t any more remarkable than many of their more recognizable predecessors. They (and their commentary writers) frequently use football generalities to move the game along, while their player-specific insights rely heavily on reciting a star’s resume. It’s not a significant change in Madden play-by-play, but I’m immensely grateful that the one-dimensional era of Phil Simms has come to a close. Unlike some prior Madden commentary pairings, it’s easy to believe that Gaudin and Davis were often in the voice over booth at the same time. It shows in their rapport, despite the fact that they’d never worked together before. Their inflections are well timed during and after plays, which goes a long way to show how engaged they are. If EA Tiburon's goal with Madden 17 was to build upon the solid foundation set by the last two iterations, the studio mostly succeeded by fine tuning its production values on and off the field while also focusing on its strengths in its Ultimate Team and Franchise. Rather than deriding this latest Madden for featuring more of the same features from previous years, there's instead comfort in the familiarity of trusted and refined features like weekly updates and the comprehensive Skills Trainer. Save for the aforementioned play-calling bug and the loading times, this is the most accessible and welcoming Madden in this console generation, which is an accomplishment for a sport that can appear complicated at first glance.",Madden NFL 17 is a football simulation game from EA Sports.,6.8
84,Alexa Ray Corriea,Mature,6,Attack on Titan,"Aug 26, 2016"," The gruesome, sometimes disturbing anime and manga series Attack on Titan has gained worldwide popularity since the comic's launch in 2009. There have been only a handful of video game adaptations, with varying success--the last one, Spike Chunsoft's Humanity in Chains which released in 2014, was an action game with an uninspired layout, a half-baked rehash of the main storyline with simple, dull gameplay. Koei Tecmo's take, on the other hand, does a bit more with the Attack on Titan property; it grafts the series' elements onto the musou genre, in which core gameplay is a series of isolated maps that must be cleared of enemies. But although Attack on Titan painfully lacks combat variety and includes a host of technical disappointments, its use of Attack on Titan's strange world makes it a unique, and sometimes genuinely exhilarating, experience. Attack on Titan recounts the events of the anime and then some--the story slips past the show's season one finale, telling tales from the ongoing manga series and foreshadowing the show's upcoming second season. Each chapter is broken up into a handful of missions that set you down on a map with specific objectives. These range from simply hacking titans to bits, protecting a specific structure on the map, or escorting soldiers from point A to point B. This is as complicated as things get. The latter half of the game, which includes narrative content past the show's first season, is unfortunately padded out; to add some length to the campaign, you are forced to complete dozens of small, formerly-optional side missions before you can advance the story. These are just as monotonous as the main missions, and after a while the campaign begins to feel like a parade of chores. You spend most of the game slinging through towns and forests like Spider-Man using Omni-Directional Mobility Gear, special machinery used to move through the air and scale heights quickly in order to attack titans. Attacking titans requires you lock onto one of the giant's limbs and use your ODM Gear to gain speed as you fly towards it--the faster you're moving, the greater the damage you'll do, and hopefully slice off its meaty leg or arm with one stroke. If you can get a titan down on the ground, or you've propelled yourself high enough, you can kill the monster for good by aiming for the nape of its neck. It takes some getting used to, and there is some nuance in learning when to deploy your anchors and when to use gas canisters to propel yourself forward or up. I had a good time with Attack on Titan's traversal system. It feels so good to sling between buildings, nailing titans in the nape of their neck for the one-shot kill as you fly from objective to objective. I felt powerful and free, like I was actually living in the Attack on Titan universe. The ODM gear is such a hallmark of the show, and having it done justice in the form of a gameplay mechanic was thrilling to experience. There are some other things you can do when fighting titans, like drop fire or smoke bombs, but you'll spend almost all of your time in battle targeting and slinging towards titan limbs. There is a severe lack of variety in mission structure as well, and if you've played a musou game the drill will be familiar: defend certain points on a map, escort AI allies to other points on the map, and kill as many enemies as you can before they overwhelm your own forces. Once you've completed all of a map's required objectives, one final ""boss"" titan will appear for you to take down. This boss titan doesn't feel any different from the smaller monstrosities you encounter and it's an easy kill. Even the different types of titans--big, small, beastly, and armored--can all be taken down in the same way with little strategy. Even on harder difficulty levels, Attack on Titan presents rather simple challenges, making for rote gameplay through the latter half of the campaign. This mission layout is the same for the multiplayer Expedition Mode, where you can team up with three other players to take on optional challenge missions. But there is no incentive to team up and take down a titan; you can simply zip to opposite sides of the map and route the enemy more quickly, with little fanfare or reward should you decide to work cooperatively. Multiplayer mode is just as cut and dry as single player mode, except now you have two other non-AI characters running around the battlefield. Cutscenes are heavily pared down and aren't as dramatic as the show, but the visuals themselves are impressive, like cells taken straight from the anime. This includes the horrifying titans, which look like someone took the heads of full-grown men and attacked them to oversized chubby baby bodies or alternatingly emaciated and bloated corpses with long, flailing limbs. And even more disturbingly, their sexless bodies are entirely naked; more than once I found myself hurtling towards the ground with a giant butt directly in front of my face, or trapped beneath the quivering belly of a downed titan. Most of the time the framerate held up, but when the screen started to fill up with titans, things became muddy. The action slowed down and the lag prevented me from landing hits. In one horrible instance, my character got stuck between the rear-ends of two titans, one of which had clipped into the geometry of a nearby building and was stuck there. Unable to land an anchor on any part of either one, I managed to frantically jettison my way out after a few awkward seconds. Attack on Titan also includes an over-simplified equipment upgrade and modification system that makes your blades slightly more powerful or grants you longer aerial time--or lets you buy a better horse for open field missions. Upgrading your gas canisters for better aerial control and your blades for toughness does make you feel more powerful, but I completed long stretches of the campaign without upgrading anything, and found missions several chapters apart didn't vary terribly in difficulty. Thus, I never felt compelled to spend time buying materials and upgrading my gear. After a certain point you are able to choose your own character, and playing as the the powerful Levi, quick-footed Mikasa, or as Eren in his Titan form is fun in its own right for fans of the series. Facing the titans, too--no matter how derpy some of them look--also provides some grotesque thrills. It's one thing to watch them chomp people in half in the anime. It's another to find yourself face to face with these grinning menaces, fighting to slip from their grip and slicing their legs from underneath them like so many haunches of meat. I actually felt like Mikasa or Levi. Attack on Titan gets you up close and personal with the terrifying beings that make Attack on Titan so great, which is reason enough to give the game a shot. Attack on Titan may be systematically simple and has some visual issues, but I still had fun playing within its world. Well-trod musou layout aside, battling titans and swinging through the skies with futuristic military gear can be an enjoyable experience--if you can look past its glaring flaws. It's not a work of art, that's for sure, but the freedom of flight and the thrill of unease that comes with fighting a titan make it entertaining.","The ""Attack on Titan"" game project is an action game being developed by Omega Force.",7.1
85,Matt Espineli,Teen,6,JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven,"Jun 28, 2016"," With such a large cast of eccentric characters and fighting styles, it's no wonder the cult favorite manga and anime series Jojo's Bizarre Adventure has repeatedly gotten the fighting game treatment over the years. The series' latest adaptation, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven, keeps the trend alive. But rather than retain the Street Fighter-esque fighting system from its predecessors, it goes for accessible team-driven combat in 3D free-roaming environments. While its new fighting system may throw off players of past Jojo games, Eyes of Heaven remains an entertaining platform for hardcore fans to engage with the series, as well as reenact or reimagine the greatest battles it has to offer. Unlike past Jojo games, Eyes of Heaven utilizes a fighting system akin to the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm series, putting its focus on easy-to-perform combos above highly technical play. However, Eyes of Heaven takes its own liberties with the established formula, emphasizing two-on-two matches where you and an AI-controlled teammate duke it out against an opposing team in a frenzied brawl. Special moves are now performed with simple button combinations subtly displayed on-screen; removing the need to memorize or understand complicated inputs. There's also the addition of a combo breaker move that can stop an opponent mid-combo and launch them away, giving you time to breathe during a challenging match. These mechanical changes make combat straightforward and accessible, creating an experience that's far easier to pickup and play compared to the more complex and abstract fighting systems of previous Jojo games. However, this doesn't mean that the fighting system is overtly simplistic; its intricacies are far more measured and understated. Each of the game's 53 characters has their own unique moveset packed with special moves that often yield a distinct execution property or effect. For instance, one character has a knockback at the end of his punching flurry attack, while another can inflict a bleeding status effect on an enemy when he hits them with his projectile move, causing their health to slowly drain over time. When used methodically, these attack properties can be strung together to create a multitude of powerful combos and setups. Despite the fact that advanced moves are easier to pull off than before, wielding them effectively requires a fair amount of practice. It's just unfortunate that there's no training mode available to better hone your skills towards executing these moves. Battles in Eyes of Heaven are hectic and satisfying, keeping you constantly engaged as you perform one damaging flurry of attacks after another. And as you get a knack for the pace and flow of combat, your string of successes are rewarded by special achievements when you reenact moments or character behaviors from the series. These inside joke-infused achievements earn you bonus points that increase your overall ranking at the end of a fight. This adds a layers of enjoyment to your growing competency of the mechanics, aligning you further into the role of your respective character through association and context. Once you've grown confident in your fighting abilities, you can take on Eyes of Heaven's story mode. Thankfully, it doesn't repeat the mistake of its predecessor--All Star Battle--by attempting to haphazardly retell the 30-plus year ongoing saga of the Jojo series with limited characters and assets. Instead, it tells an original crossover story that throws its multi-generational cast of protagonists into a conflict against a mysterious foe known as the ""Noble One."" (Be wary: if you haven't watched or read far into the series, there are major spoilers of key plot points for later arcs.) While the addition of a fully-fledged story mode with an original narrative is an inviting notion for longtime fans, its execution is tedious and lacks pacing. The story comes across more as mediocre fanfiction, displaying none of the over-the-top and dramatic qualities that makes Jojo's arcs so captivating. The problem with story mode lies in its repetition; you're thrown into a predictable cycle throughout the 20-hour campaign, slogging through a multitude of repeated battle encounters under the same premise. The premise is as follows: your group of characters meets brainwashed versions of a couple of their old allies; you reluctantly fight them and once they're down, you cure them of their affliction and they join your team. This repeats until you obtain all 34 protagonists of the story mode's character roster. There are encounters that attempt to add variety to the monotony you're thrown into, such as fighting against waves of zombie vampires or playing a poker mini-game. But these moments are fleeting and do little to improve the tedium, as the story instantly turns around and repeats on the same old tired premise to push its plot forward. As an unfortunate result, the constant repetition also ends up detracting from the enjoyment of combat, rendering it a middling affair due to the dull framing of the narrative. In the face of such a mundane story mode, it helps that Eyes of Heaven's visual presentation is so vibrant and endearing. Characters are faithfully rendered with an attention to detail that expertly captures the dynamic art of series creator Hirohiko Araki. A large number of the character models and animations have been recycled from All Star Battle, but they hold up well here, retaining a sharp aesthetic appeal thanks to a slight boost in detail and graphical fidelity. Each character is also brought to life with a pitch perfect cast of Japanese voice actors, whose performances elevate the plethora of fanservice moments they're thrown into. Eyes of Heaven contains far more banter between matches than All Star Battle, and it's an absolute joy to hear some of the series' most beloved characters speaking to one another with full authentic voice acting. From hearing a young Jotaro instruct his future daughter how to find the best punching angle, to hearing Dio acknowledge the fighting prowess of a certain italian-born fighter; moments like these heighten the excitement and add weight to the battles that ensue. Aside from Story Mode and Free Battle--a mode that allows you to partake in one-off matches against the CPU--Eyes of Heaven also offers you the ability to play against others online. However, the netcode is incredibly unstable, featuring heavy input lag and erratic frame-rate. It's unfortunate that there's no local multiplayer options to compensate for the near-broken online mode, as the rare moments where competitive play did work amidst the lag proved to be energetic and tense. Eyes of Heaven's issues hold it back from being as refined as other fighters, but I kept finding myself coming back to play more long after completing its story mode. The ability to play as such a large number of the series' most iconic characters, chaining their famous attack techniques into destructive combos, is a powerful and mesmerizing experience that serves as a fulfilling recompense that eases the frustrations elsewhere. And with a slew of single-player bonus fights, and countless character costumes and poses to unlock, there's a wealth of content available to maintain an ongoing sense of satisfaction. When Eyes of Heaven allows itself to simply deliver on the quality of its fan-serving premise and accessible combat, the game shines even during its lowest moments; and for the most dedicated lot of fans, this can be more than enough to absolve its biggest flaws. Those unfamiliar with Jojo are likely to be bewildered playing Eyes of Heaven; the game pulls no punches in declaring its priorities with its thick layer of fanservice, pleasing only those who've read far into the series' three decade long run. It's an unfortunate misgiving to newcomers, but for fans, it's unequivocal bliss. Eyes of Heaven's foibles can be inexcusable to many, but it remains an entertaining, accessible fighter that fans shouldn't hesitate to try: ""Do you understand?""","JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven is the next action-packed title under development at famed Japanese videogame developer, CyberConnect2.",7
86,Jason D'Aprile,Teen,8,Alone With You,"Aug 23, 2016"," Your enjoyment of Alone With You depends largely on how much you value narration. As a homage to classic 80s-style Sierra adventure games, this is first and foremost a piece of interactive storytelling. It bears thematic similarities to a lot of other science fiction stories, but the personal nature of the story gives Alone With You a somber yet relatable presence . The basic premise of Alone With You is this: the lone survivor of a disastrous terraforming operation is trying to repair an escape pod before the planet in question explodes. This survivor, who wears their space suit through the whole game, is never really identified. You give them a name at the start, but never see any of their defining characteristics. This enables you to easily project your own identity preferences on the character. It’s a clever move in a game largely about conversation and developing deep relationships with others. Alone With You is billed as a “sci-fi romance adventure,” which sums it up nicely. At the start, your only companion is an AI that's desperate to find a means of escape before it’s too late. A rift has formed within the structure of the planet, possibly caused (or at least exacerbated by) the mining and terraforming operations. Acid rain and earthquakes pummel the landscape amidst huge storms, causing immense damage to the various facilities on the surface. Since time is short and you’re just one human with indeterminate skillsets, the AI does something rather radical to get the expertise necessary to repair the one remaining space ship: it creates four holographic AI representations of technicians from the former colony. These four represent the skills needed to repair the fuel, engines, food, and communications systems. More than that, however, they also provide your only link--however artificial--with humanity. These four technicians might be simulations, but they’re seemingly conscious and human in their behavior. Since they were generated based on monitoring records, their memories only extend to the moment right before the rift occurred, stifling all outside communications. With believable emotions, your holographic comrades suffer from self-doubt regarding the nature of their being. Alone With You isn’t a personality simulation or AI experiment, though. It’s a fairly linear interactive novella. The game moves in days, and each day you can visit one location. Each location is associated with one of the four holographic crew members. Conversations are often one-sided, as you listen to characters talk about their work, their lives, and their relationships. At certain times, you’ll be prompted to select one of few responses, which convey positivity, negativity, or ambivalence. The rest of the game revolves around exploration, item hunts, and puzzles. Each location contains logs, journals, and even stories to discover that add depth to the characters and your dire situation. You’ll have to find specific items necessary to repair the ship, ranging from crystalline fuel and ship parts to viable sources of food. It's a simple task unfortunately made time-consuming due to how difficult it can be to spot key items in environments filled with potential objects of interest. The characters, including the base’s AI, are all fully realized individuals that lend surprising emotions to the simple interactive experience. In a particularly old school nod, I found myself having to pay far more attention to all those notes and logs to solve puzzles. None of the puzzles in the game are overly challenging, but there’s no quest log and you never find a handy list of texts. As a result,I frequently had to take notes to remember clues, names, and numbers needed to figure out passwords and door codes. Of the artificial men and women you interact with, you can bond with whomever you wish, leading to once-a-week private rendezvous with subtle romantic undertones. These dialogue sequences add depth to the characters and overall story, and do a great job of it. The holograms’ main goal is getting you off the planet alive, and while their self-confidence wavers, they never veer from that objective. Alone With You is remarkably well-written, even when it delves into dangerously melodramatic waters. The characters, including the base’s AI, are all fully realized individuals that lend surprising emotions to the simple interactive experience. There are a couple other distinct aspects to Alone With You. The retro, heavily pixelated artwork is strangely atmospheric despite the lack of fine detail. There’s a lot of grim imagery and the overall tragic tone feels a bit more bearable without graphic depictions of death and destruction. This is a game that warrants repeated playthroughs to see both endings and experience other relationship choices. Alone With You bears some heavy thematic overlap with recent games like SOMA, Everyone’s Gone to Rapture, and other story-centric releases that focus on the nature of what makes you human, the importance of relationships and contact, and mortality. It’s different enough to feel new despite its retro roots, delivering impactful scenes that shine thanks to a stellar script that brings its few, but emotionally charged, characters to life.  ",,8
87,Mike Mahardy,,7,Master of Orion,"Aug 25, 2016"," Master of Orion is a game with grand scope and massive scale, and more often than not, both work to its advantage. You explore outer space, colonize planets, and swing other leaders on a clandestine dance floor of galactic diplomacy, all with an overarching plan in mind. The problem is, Master of Orion doesn't always make that process fun. It vacillates between moments of exhilaration and periods of boredom. Commonly referred to as a 4X title (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate), Master of Orion is a reboot of an earlier series of the same name. The first Master of Orion draws easy comparisons to Civilization, another franchise in which you guide a nation from its nascent years to its swan song through various victory conditions. But over time both franchises have drifted apart, introducing their own twists on the empire-building formula throughout the years. One of the few notable changes in this new Master of Orion is an optional real-time combat system that allows for a more hands-on approach to inter-fleet skirmishes. You can divert individual ships and focus fire on specific enemies, using the agility of your frigates and the firepower of your battleships to pick apart enemy clusters. This combat system works well on several levels. Primarily, it adds unpredictability to combat that's otherwise based on mathematics and predetermined outcomes. If your small collection of frigates faces off against a hardened group of cruisers, odds are, the ""auto-resolve"" option will lead to defeat. But if you take the time to direct your fleet on a micro level with daring maneuvers, you have the potential to upend the odds in your favor. Secondly, this form of combat narrows Master of Orion's focus from what's otherwise a sweeping look at the history of several civilizations. It drops you from the admiral's chair to the cockpit of a fighter vessel. Not only does it change up each playthrough's pacing, but sets the stage for a fine balance between micro and macro managing your people's development. This bouncing between big picture problems and minute concerns is where Master of Orion shines brightest. You plot the course of an entire civilization, establish your presence in numerous solar systems, and bring about the end of entire alien races--but you also upgrade your frigates' laser cannons. You bribe the Alkari leader with a few billion credits. You build mining outposts on forgotten moons in the outer reaches of the galaxy. There's a vast difference between the bird's eye view of a political leader and the tactical considerations of a hangar bay engineer. But Master of Orion uses that contrast to its advantage. It links strategy and tactics with seamless ease. This dynamism between the large and small scale can also change up Master of Orion's pacing, which often becomes rote in the mid-game turns of playthroughs. This problem has plagued the best of 4X strategy games, and unfortunately, this reboot doesn't find any way around it. Unless you're at the outset of your budding civilization, engaged in combat, or guiding your people in the last few years before that exhilarating grab at military, technological, economic, or diplomatic victory, turns become mundane. Colonies often lack individualism, utilizing the same structures and constructing the same military units as the planets in their neighboring systems. Aside from the occasional thrilling space battle, playthroughs are seldom all that different from the ones preceding them. Master of Orion's chief allure--the promise of exploring uncharted solar systems--is only novel for a few hours. Furthermore, the game's chief allure--the promise of exploring uncharted solar systems--is only novel for a few hours. It soon becomes clear that, aside from a handful of different biomes, planet sizes, and mineral types, there's not enough variety between planets to encourage exploration for its own sake. Maps also lack many surprising discoveries in the space between systems--you'll come across ancient artifacts, stray clouds of debris, and rogue pirate bases, but again, after a few hours, you'll likely see it all. Exploring can reveal bright spots on the sci-fi game's sprawling star map, but also a lot of empty space. What Master of Orion lacks in variety, though, it makes up for in fine-tuned design. The galactic map, composed of multitudinous star systems and the quantum warp paths connecting them, leads to interesting strategic quandaries for your scouts and battle fleets. Defending individual star systems means guarding warp points and building defensive emplacements around your key settlements. Managing the interlocking web of colonies and the established lines of travel between them is key to preserving your people, or destroying someone else's. This is supported by the combat system, which pierces through the ennui of Master of Orion's exploration. There's another web at play here: the diplomacy system is a minefield of bad tempers, interlocking alliances, and cultural pet peeves. The leader of the Sakka Brood, a reptilian race, doesn't value scientific advancement, and because of this, won't trade credits for your advanced technological knowledge. The Skylord of the Alkari Flock is aggressive by nature, and will declare war if you demonstrate too much good will toward the civilization's enemies. Master of Orion's diplomacy system isn't a separate entity from the rest of the game, but the foundation of many other mechanics. It excels in making you consider your diplomatic choices. It lends weight to hefty decisions elsewhere in your unfolding nation. The presentation of these various alien races, and the emotions motivating them, drives home a personal touch in a game that otherwise focuses on sociological management and technological progress. The voice acting grounds the alien leaders and makes them feel like real characters. After several full playthroughs, I know to never trust the silver tongued Darlok. I know to be on the defensive around the Terran. I know the Bulrathi are valuable allies in a tight spot. Master of Orion succeeds in depicting intergalactic events in a smaller, more intimate context, and it lends compelling reasons to steer your civilization one way or another. And that's the thing about Master of Orion: there are plenty of weighty decisions, risky maneuvers, and impactful events to consider. But they often take place in repetitive playthroughs in galaxies that don't always differentiate themselves from the next. Master of Orion shows signs of brilliance, but it's bogged down by boredom, and sometimes, the allure of the stars wanes too much to beckon us onward.  ",,7.5
88,Edmond Tran,,7,Obduction,"Aug 24, 2016"," I often got real, physical headaches while playing Obduction. Towards the end of the game, I’d regularly get completely stuck when trying to solve a puzzle, decide I was missing something vital to its solution, and proceed to run back and forth through the game’s sizeable world, searching every area multiple times, eyes glued to the screen. I’d take a wrong turn in a thick forest, retrace my steps, get lost again, and then get mad at myself. But when I eventually did stumble upon that missing link--an obscured set of stairs, a line in a book I’d previously dismissed--the pieces fell into place, and my frustrations all but disintegrated. I'd unlock a majestic gate, the soundtrack would swell, and I'd discover a breathtaking new region, full of fresh, difficult puzzles. Created by the same developers behind classic adventure games Myst and Riven, Obduction presents a eerie world filled with tough puzzles to solve and intriguing lore to uncover. At the start of the game, you’re transported to an area that’s immediately stunning and perplexing--rocky desert mountains smattered with distinct American architecture from throughout history: an Old West frontier town, a 1950s gas station, a graffitied rail yard. While this initial sun-drenched area feels invitingly warm on first glance, there’s also an underlying sense of otherworldly menace. Distant horizons are lined with enormous purple crystalline formations and floating islands. The occasional waft of tense violins in the soundscape lends the familiar architecture an off-kilter slant. Real-world actors portray strange characters in odd hologram messages, and every part of that feels a little out of place. And even though you seem to be alone, the bizarre nature of the environment stops you from feeling in control. Obduction emphasises player discovery, and while you're given some broad direction in the beginning, it quickly falls away. Obduction doesn’t draw attention to its obstacles--there’s no strict order of progression, and its puzzles are hidden in plain sight as part of the environment. Key items aren't highlighted by default (the option to turn them on is labeled as a “hint” system) and only reveal themselves as interactive objects when you get close enough. In order to both discover and solve problems, you’re required to scour the meticulously detailed world to find levers, switches, cryptic clues, narrative details, ciphers, and other useful items. Characteristic of Obduction's roots in the Myst series, it’s the game’s encouragement for discovery that makes puzzles fun--and it’s their complex, mechanical nature that makes them so satisfying to decipher. Obduction’s obstacles often involve manipulating physical objects and contraptions. Punching buttons to enter a code or dragging your mouse to pull a lever gives each step in a puzzle’s solution a pleasing, tangible quality. Rumbling iron gears and mysteriously high-tech gates make for a wonderful audiovisual reward on top of the gratification that comes from resolving a tricky puzzle. However, Obduction is unrelenting in its lack of player assistance, and some solutions are more obscure and obtuse than others. While you have the option to make some objects glint unnaturally, keying you into their importance, some clues are purely visual and provide no indication of how they might interact with other clues, if at all. In every case, it’s completely up to you to connect the dots and to figure out how an object or clue might be useful. It can be invigorating to have a sudden breakthrough and rush to test your theory, but the process can also be incredibly draining. I frequently felt stumped or completely baffled, but this depends upon how observant you may or may not be at the time. This directionless feeling does initially enhance the mystique of the game’s first half, when locations are mostly undiscovered and you lack a holistic understanding of how the world works--new discoveries are especially magical at this point because they are full of unknowns. But challenges become increasingly difficult and complex, and a lapse in patience or observation can lead to punishing gaps in your knowledge of the world's logic, which can take a painful amount of time to identify and ultimately resolve. One overlooked clue can completely halt your momentum and cost you large amounts of time, making rewarding successes fewer and further between. In its final hours, Obduction introduces intricately grand puzzles that involve environmental manipulation and traveling between different, interconnected locations at predetermined points. Although clever, these scenarios often require a large amount of backtracking and the endurance to withstand a collection of loading screens as you travel back and forth--a process that grows increasingly exhausting. Because of the size of the game’s world and the numerous mechanisms that can restrict access to certain routes, getting lost while backtracking can also become a very real frustration and increase the chances of missing vital clues. This is an experience that requires you to play with patience, but there are times when your best intentions aren't enough. Although you may feel at odds with Obduction's late-game complexity, it still feeds into an incredibly alluring world that earns intimate engagement. Its puzzles require keen observation and perseverance, and while player-made missteps can lead to mental fatigue, Obduction's commitment to keeping the onus of discovery on you means that deciphering the game’s intricate puzzles is often gratifying despite occasional frustrations along the way. Just make sure to take breaks and clear your head once in a while.","Everyday life is gone. An organic artifact that fell from the sky inexplicably transports you across the universe.

89,Mat Paget,Teen,7,Valley,"Aug 23, 2016"," Video games that nail the act of movement often allow you to flow freely and come down from a sprint naturally. Blue Isle Studios' Valley lets you build up exhilarating momentum while you sprint and leap through forests and fields, but your pace is too often interrupted, and trying to get back to that high level of speed takes longer than it should. Thankfully, Valley has more going for it, including fascinating lore pertaining to experimental technology, secret organizations, and unusual mythology. It's a brief experience with a few unwelcome pit stops, but you leave hungry for more regardless of the issues you experience along the way. This first-person platformer puts you in the shoes of an archaeologist in search of the mythological Life Seed; an object with extraordinary power. Following a canoe crash, you surface in a valley that feels ripped out of a fairytale, sparkly sprites and all. As you make your way through it, you come across an exoskeleton--the L.E.A.F. Suit--that grants you incredible speed and grappling abilities. The L.E.A.F. suit was originally used for excavation and research purposes during the first half of the twentieth century, which is revealed via audio tapes and written notes throughout the game. It's through these that you learn more about the valley's unusual past. The notes and tapes often correlate with specific areas in the world. For example, you might come across a message referring to a L.E.A.F. suit sports league right before you come across an area suited for the fictional competition, providing evidence that the valley was populated prior to a cataclysmic event. The titular valley is home to friendly, pint-sized sprites, but it also houses two types of hostile entities: swarms of insects and a wizard-like creature. When you're engaged in combat with these foes, it feels more like you're casting magic as opposed to firing a gun, because you shoot out balls of energy to kill enemies. It's initially satisfying when you take several shots in rapid succession and hit your intended targets, but repetitive enemy behavior and animations lead to diminishing returns over time. There are times when you're able to move at top speed and revel in the thrill of flying through the air while the environment around you whips by in a blur. However, the L.E.A.F. suit is too easily slowed by basic obstacles and hills. The suit's Magnetic Core ability also forces you to slow down to traverse metallic surfaces on occasion, an unfortunate shift in a game that's built for speed. Valley shines when you're charging forward, but it too often holds you back from going as fast as you'd like. If you happen to die during combat or from a poorly planned leap, you respawn, but life in the valley takes a toll as nature--once verdant--fades and shrivels around you. Once it's drained, your game is over. However, it's not something you need to worry about; a few rejuvenating blasts from your suit is all it takes to revive dead plants and animals to keep your journey going. And as long as you don't fall off any cliffs or into significant bodies of water, it's unlikely that you'll die in the first place. Your life and ammunition both come from the same pool, and you regularly find orbs and power generators scattered across the environment. There's little at stake, and it's rare that you'll find cause for concern to begin with. Valley's multiple environments are generally good-looking and varied, with wide open spaces, claustrophobic underground caves, and industrial areas. With the wind at your back, it can be a fun world to play around in that's occasionally captivating to behold, and certain sections, particularly when you get the ability to run on water, feel momentous and exciting. Sadly, Valley occasionally suffers from framerate drops on consoles during hectic scenes, where the PC version proves far more stable. It never drops low enough to the point where it renders the game unplayable, but it's still disappointing when it happens. Valley feels like a good first act. Despite obstacles that tend to abruptly kill your momentum, running and bounding through wilderness remained exciting. The world's history is so intriguing that I left wanting to know more. I didn't want the adventure to end, and like a jogger who's forced to slow down in the middle of a run, I was frustrated that Valley had to end so soon after it began.

90,Jason D'Aprile,Everyone,5,Grow Up,"Aug 16, 2016"," Grow Up, Ubisoft’s sequel to last year’s quirky Grow Home, is likely to be a divisive game. It's unintuitive and clunky, but this adds some charm to B.U.D., the plant-climbing protagonist with a funky gait. Grow Up's levels are heavily bent on vertical travel, and though B.U.D.'s controls make climbing arguably more challenging than it should be, you're treated to impressive views once you get the hang of his peculiar abilities and reach new heights. There's enough joy and humor to convince you to bear Grow Up's issues for a little while, but it's a difficult game to recommend on that basis alone. For those who haven’t experienced the weirdness of this series, you play as B.U.D., a botany-focused robot who likes to climb, plant seeds, and generally jump around a lot. Grow Up has a barebones plot, but it’s a good enough fit for the nonsensical yet charming characters. As the story begins, B.U.D.’s ship has crashed and split apart, so our goofy fellow must go around and collect the necessary ship parts to escape the planet. Once you get into the rhythm of Grow Up's challenges, it’s not a very long game--maybe four to six hours at best. Learning to climb to a floating island in the sky via obscure, out-of-the-way paths can feel more like a chore than an enjoyable challenge. And B.U.D. is a ragdoll nightmare of a robot, walking around like a sloppy marionette; jumping as if he’s in low gravity. There’s an incredibly steep learning curve to overcome if you want to be a fast and efficient adventurer. The frequently wonky camera doesn’t help matters either, requiring near-constant tweaking to stay focused on whatever floating platform you’re attempting to reach. Basic elements like climbing are unfortunately overcomplicated. You have to use the shoulder buttons--mapped to each of B.U.D.’s limbs--in concert to grab objects and climb the sides of vertical terrain, one hand after the other. There’s an awkward rhythm in making the little robot climb one limb at a time, and one misstep can lead to a punishing fall. Merely climbing onto low-rises feels clumsy due to B.U.D.’s erratic movements, and there’s frequently a complete lack of direction in how to navigate some of the world's more complicated paths. At times, your journey feels like a surreal series of futile exercises. You’ll analyze and collect seeds from new plants, but there’s seldom any explanation for why specific seeds matter. Some are useful--like plants that springboard you across the surface or shoot you high into the air--but there are plenty of plants--prickly cactuses, for example--that don’t directly affect mobility and are rarely used. Oddly, planting your own seeds becomes an afterthought since the game tends to have the required plants already growing where you’ll need them. To help offset some of these difficulties, Grow Up gives you a jetpack early on, as well as a sky brake that lets B.U.D. float slowly through the sky instead of plummeting downward. These vital tools help a lot when it comes to correcting potentially frustrating miscalculations, but they can't make up for the moment-to-moment difficulties. On the positive side, the beautifully primitive geometric landscape is full of fascinating details. Grow Up isn’t exactly “retro”--it’s more that the game intentionally uses low-polygon visuals to evoke a light-hearted mood. The strange creatures on this alien world all bring their own brand of quirky behaviors, which compliment the comedic appeal of B.U.D.'s off-kilter movements. Grow Up plays with gameplay elements that are unapologetically unwieldy. When even basic things like jumping and climbing feel clumsy, it’s difficult to get excited about playing with B.U.D., even if he elicits a laugh or two. There’s enough charm and visually rewarding exploration to make Grow Up worth a look if you can get past the control issues, but that's ultimately easier said than done.","BUD, an adorable yet clumsy, stumbling, tumbling robot.

91,Mike Mahardy,,7,Mother Russia Bleeds,"Sep 5, 2016"," There is nothing subtle about Mother Russia Bleeds. Heads explode into clouds of pulp, riots erupt in city squares, and prisons become Jackson Pollock paintings of blood, corpses, and human bile. In short, Mother Russia Bleeds is an exercise in frenzied combat and hyper-violent themes. The problem is, it doesn't always know what to do with them. As a 2D brawler, Mother Russia Bleeds plays host to ideas dozens of years old, hearkening back to the days of beat 'em ups on arcade cabinets and early consoles. Mother Russia Bleeds allows you and up to three other players punch, kick, headbutt, and shoot your way through crowds of thugs in an alternate reality 80s Russia, with simple controls and a variety of weapons to use along the way. Where so many brawlers succumb to repetitive encounters, Mother Russia Bleeds, on the other hand, is a shining example of how to extract complex scenarios from simple mechanics. This is due in large part to the way its stages unfold. You not only grapple with a slew of multifarious fighters, but also wrestle attack dogs, leap away from speeding motorcycles, and evade clouds of poisonous gas. You'll learn how to control your fighter easily, but defeating a boss while trains barrel back and forth across the screen is another task entirely. In fact, the boss battles are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to creative combat situations. Of the many present in Mother Russia Bleeds, a few stand out: luring helicopter turrets to shred your surrounding attackers; using flashbangs to stun opponents equipped with night-vision goggles; hurling enemies' grenades back at them as they advance behind a wall of riot shields. Mother Russia Bleeds is replete with brawls like this, and they upset the pacing of the beat em' up genre in exhilarating ways. Mother Russia Bleeds exudes a gorgeous retro pixel-art style, reflecting the existing design traits of its early brawler influences. Blood pools in the corners of the stage, with rough edges making their way down to the rectangular limbs of rotting corpses. The grisly aesthetic at play is an homage to the past, but it's rooted in very adult themes and background compositions: some of the most shocking include sexual acts at an S&M club, or the deranged acts of drug addicts going through withdrawal. This is where Mother Russia Bleeds both excels and falters. For every insight it has about oppression, violence, and the direct correlations between both, it makes missteps elsewhere. It examines the effects a dictatorship can have on the common person, and whether violent action is ever justified when the government has gone too far. But too much of this brawler seems present just for shock value. Just as intriguing ideas gain traction, Mother Russia Bleeds introduces prison rape tropes or sexual jokes that upset any profundity it almost found. Mother Russia Bleeds is replete with creative brawls, and they upset the pacing of the beat em' up genre in exhilarating ways. A common thread is drug addiction--how it sneaks up on people, introduces itself slowly into their lives, and takes hold when they least expect it. From a gameplay perspective, drugs actually help you through the brawler: you can use Nekkro, a substance the dictatorial government uses to control its lower class citizens, to heal yourself or grant increased damage for a short time. If you don't completely behead an enemy, you can siphon the Nekkro from their blood, giving you more to use in the event of a future emergency. This creates a tense risk/reward factor throughout fistfights: should you drain that enemy's Nekkro now, and use the health to defeat the next mini-boss? Or should you destroy the crowd of enemies quickly and hope the Nekkro hasn't completely drained from their veins in the aftermath? Then there's the matter of cooperative play, and here, Mother Russia Bleeds is it at its finest. The obvious thrill of fighting alongside a friend or two is present, but the Nekkro dynamic becomes tantamount in multiplayer situations, considering you can heal allies with your drug supply. In some cases, I kept my Nekkro to myself. In others, I valued my friend's revival over my own peril. Drug addiction becomes not just a storytelling theme, but a gameplay motif as well. It's in its final moments that Mother Russia Bleeds approaches greatness, just before it stumbles. The final boss is one of the most abrasive difficulty spikes I've ever encountered in a game, let alone a difficult beat em' up. It took me 90 minutes to finally best. Compare that to about 20 minutes on the more difficult enemies I encountered throughout my playthrough. For all of the ways Mother Russia Bleeds paces itself so well over the course of 6 hours, its ending is drawn out to a fault. But for all of my frustration with the encounter, the difficulty of this boss made thematic sense: I had eliminated many thugs along my journey through a war torn Russia, from army captains to sadistic drug lords. But as its story comes to a close, and without spoiling the resolution, Mother Russia Bleeds asks the more important, if not slightly clichéd, question: isn't your biggest enemy yourself? This is Mother Russia Bleeds' greatest strength: it may appear to be a simple brawler with retro art reminiscent of the beat em' up golden age. But it goes much deeper. It alleviates the monotony of some of the best brawlers. It introduces wrinkles that make each level feel fresh. And it weaves complex themes into its gameplay in ways that, although not subtle, are nuanced. Mother Russia Bleeds knows how to upset many expectations of the genre--I just wish it wasn't always trying to shock me.","Mother Russia Bleeds is an ultra-violent co-op brawler overflowing with an unmistakable style and unforgettably brutal action for up to four players at once. Set in an alternate U.S.S.R, the story centers on a desperate crew of imprisoned street fighters that must overcome an oppressive criminal authority and crippling drug addictions through any means necessary.",5.7
92,Danny O'Dwyer,Everyone,8,F1 2016,"Aug 18, 2016"," Codemasters' Formula One racing series has evolved in small ways over the years, but like real-world F1 cars, the devil is in the details. Adjustments that may seem menial from afar can have a significant impact in practice. It's not until the rubber hits the road that we can truly see how much better a driving experience F1 2016 truly delivers. This is a game that expertly captures the thrill of racing and the satisfaction of executing a winning strategy. With demanding car controls and increased authenticity that feeds into the excitement of high-speed races, F1 2016 is the best the series has ever seen. Racing in F1 2016 is thrilling and tense, which is largely due to an improved physics model that defines the relationship between your car and the track. Now, cold tires have even less grip at the start of the race, and worn wheels force you to be careful while accelerating out of corners. Grip is nothing new to the series, of course, but the way in which tires evolve across miles of straights and braking zones feels more authentic than ever. Not only does the grip feel more realistic, but the supporting mechanisms around it have also been improved to empower you as a driver. The importance of communicating with your engineer is emphasized more than ever, allowing for strategy changes if you push too hard and wear out your tires too early in the race. Formation laps have been added, allowing you to warm up your tires and brakes before the actual race starts, which delivers a palpable sense of anticipation to the start of each race. Adding to this tension is the option of manual starts. These reward fast reflexes, as you're challenged to keep the engine at the optimal RPM by holding down the throttle, only releasing the clutch as the lights go out. Release too late, and expect to see a lot of cars overtake you before the first corner. Release too early, and you’ll be punished with a drive-through penalty. That's the core of what makes F1 2016 such an enjoyable experience. The balancing act between skill and race strategy feels right for the first time in the series. Maybe you've pushed too hard on a set of ultra-soft tires at the start of the race. Do you move to a strategy that incorporates an extra pit stop? Or do you attempt to wrestle the slippery tires around the track for a few laps? These are the decisions you have to make in F1 2016 while simultaneously trying to hit each apex, manage fuel, and steer clear of your competitors. If you do collide on the track, crashes are more spectacular than ever. Suspension arms buckle as you shunt a wall at high speed, and shards of carbon fiber shoot up like confetti when your front wing clips another car. The replay system allows you to rewind time if you miss a corner and careen into a competitor, but you should get used to avoiding crashes. Big crashes are followed by a safety car that drives ahead of the pack, slowing it down, while the brand-new virtual safety car requires you to limit your own speed through areas of the track where stricken cars are being recovered. F1 2016 reflects the ""anything can happen"" reality of F1 racing. All of this combines to create an exciting experience where each lap around the track feels critical. Dynamic weather scenarios allow you to control the weather during custom races. A new sunlight slider allows you to select what time of day you race--even going so far as to allow you to race Singapore's Marina Bay Street Circuit, a track we normally only ever see at nighttime, in broad daylight. There's a brand-new circuit in this year's game, too, thanks to the recent addition of the Baku City Circuit in Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, improved lighting, more environmental detail, and a wonderfully fluid 60fps on both consoles and PC help make each track come to life. It's in the selection of game modes that F1 2016 feels a lot less revolutionary, however. This year has the same quick race and career options seen in previous editions, with nothing new added. The game offers some fresh touches, such as 22-person multiplayer and the ability to choose your driver's ethnicity, though sadly, female drivers aren’t available. A disappointing omission, especially considering how common female test drivers have become in the sport. Though the modes are familiar, the on-track action in F1 2016 is the best the series has ever seen. Whether you're darting into the pits to take advantage of a virtual safety car in Monaco, screaming around Eau Rouge on a worn pair of super-softs, or turning sharply to avoid a racing incident, F1 2016 is frequently thrilling. The improved physics ensure the act of driving is entertaining, and working with your engineer to create a winning strategy is deeply satisfying. The technical problems from last year's edition are gone, replaced by a game that purrs its way around the track like a well-oiled machine. F1 2016 is a terrific racing game that’s fun to play regardless of whether you enjoy tackling a full career mode or prefer a quick five-lap race around your favorite circuit.","Create your own legend in F1 2016. Get ready to go deeper into the world of the most prestigious motorsport than ever before.

93,Alexa Ray Corriea,,8,Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice,"Sep 8, 2016"," In its recent past, the Ace Attorney series has moved away from using mysticism and more fantastical elements in its plot. That all changes with Spirit of Justice, in which you'll find yourself questioning just how grounded the roots of series' legend and myth are. Sporting a cast of familiar faces and a handful of compelling new ones, Spirit of Justice may be the most involved Phoenix Wright title in recent years, with complex murder trials that culminate in you feeling both smart and relieved. It's refreshing to see the series go full-supernatural this time around and step up its difficulty, a criticism of the last game. There are a few moments where the tension and drama lag thanks to some vapid court antics, but this is small potatoes compared to the beautifully crafted web of intrigue blanketing the rest of the experience. Spirit of Justice opens with Phoenix on vacation in Khura'in, an eccentric country without separation of church and state. Here, guilty verdicts are determined by conjuring the final memories of murder victims, and there are no defense attorneys to speak of thanks to a law tying lawyers' fates to their clients. After agreeing to defend his tour guide against a murder charge and a run in with Rayfa, the hot-headed princess of Khura'in, Phoenix and the rest of the Wright Anything Agency are swept up in the tide of revolution threatening to overtake the country. A colorful cast of familiar faces from previous games and oddball newcomers round out the adventure, which takes Phoenix and company across the world and back on a quest to debunk (or prove) myths and stem the tide of war. You spend your time in Spirit of Justice doing one of two things: investigating crime scenes or mentally sparring in court. Investigation portions take cues from point and click adventures; using the 3DS touchscreen and stylus, you point to objects in the environment for a closer examination. Sometimes you'll get the chance to observe objects more closely by using the touchscreen to rotate and zoom in on finer details. In this way you'll find hidden clues and fingerprints, small things with big potential for finding the true culprit. Oftentimes characters connected to the events will appear, and you'll get the opportunity to interview them to unearth more details of the crime.   Sifting through a crime scene doesn't just yield facts about a case, however. In this situations, you'll often spark some entertaining banter between characters. Junior lawyer Apollo will squabble with fellow attorney Athena over his fear of heights, Phoenix's adopted daughter Trucy will flirt with Apollo, and Rafya will verbally rip Phoenix a new one before making jokes about his potential execution with a smile on her face. These investigation scenes also offer opportunities to get to know Khura'in, a territory new to the series, and all its myriad idiosyncrasies. Khura'in itself, with its deep ties to spirituality and obsession with prayer and soul-cleansing, can be considered a character here, and it's colorful customs makes it an intriguing, attention-grabbing locale to spend time in. But it's in courtrooms that Spirit of Justice really shines. While investigation segments follow a checklist of tasks you must complete before court, once the trial begins that predictability flies out the window. Like all Ace Attorney games, trials follow a pattern: introduce a witness, hear their testimony, cross-examine them to pry out more information, and find inconsistencies between their words and the evidence at hand. While some witnesses' lies are easy to counter, others run deeper, and the murders committed in Spirit of Justice carry a surprising amount of complexity and take significant brain power to unravel. There were times when I felt genuinely stuck, unsure of what detail I was missing--there's enough to unpack in each case that simply presenting random evidence through trial and error won't get you anywhere. When I finally discovered the truths behind who committed the act and why, I felt smart. These puzzles are clever without requiring the player to follow along with any bizarre logical leaps, making Spirit of Justice's cases a welcome challenge. The added wrinkle in Spirit of Justice's courtroom is also a welcome change-up from the series' typical dynamic. In trials in Khura'in we have the Divination Seance, in which Rayfa conjures a victim's memories and displays them in a pool in the center of the room. She then offers her Insights, or her take on what the display means, and from there you must use hard evidence to pick apart her conclusions for misinterpretations. Proving Rayfa wrong means the difference between a guilty verdict and a less damning one--and provides some interesting character development moments for the young princess. The dynamic between Rayfa and Phoenix is an interesting one, and as the girl is defeated by our lauded attorney time and time again, her prickly facade begins to break down in interesting, and sometimes outright sorrowful ways. In addition to this new courtroom mechanic, what makes Spirit of Justice such a delight is its large cast, which opens up into more varied gameplay and welcome moments of character development. Every system you can think of from previous games is back: you'll dust for fingerprints with forensics expert Ema Skye and take time to chat with her about her growing career; you'll use the Psych-Locks Maya and Phoenix have used to break through witnesses' emotional defenses; Athena will run quick therapy sessions in court with her Mood Matrix; and Apollo will detect lies with his magical bracelet. Each case gives access to any combination of these tools, keeping things varied and interesting. And of course, it's a thrill to have Maya Fey back after being absent from the series for several years, and to watch Athena and prosecutor Simon Blackquill have a bonding moment over a case. Spirit of Justice masterfully weaves a tale of intrigue across warring cultures with enough breathing room for relationship to bud. Spirit of Justice also includes some shocking revelations about well-known characters' pasts. Plot twists come without warning and take their time revealing explanation, creating a tantalizing tension as these stories unravel. The dive back into the Fey clan and spirit channeling is a welcome treat, and adds another dimension to picking apart cases and begs the question: how much of a myth is actually a myth? The only big drag in Spirit of Justice is that one of its major, hours-long cases is boring. The normally-quirky witnesses and suspects feel flat, the banter across prosecution and defense is dull, and the logic puzzles offered up pale in comparison to the intricacies of the game's other cases. But one lame case doesn't prevent the rest of Spirit of Justice from becoming a glowing, well-sought experience. And despite some rather goofy localization decisions involving name puns and an overuse of the word ""putrid,"" after this more mellow case, you'll be itching to get back to Khura'in and spending more time with Maya. Finally, production values have gone way up since Dual Destinies. Spirit of Justice includes full in-game cutscenes--such as Rayfa's Dance of Devotion and several scenes in which Phoenix bursts into court or Apollo and Athena fiddle with evidence. These cutscenes, as well as the ever-present anime ones, look wonderful and are a treat to watch after hours of plain avatar-focused conversations. Spirit of Justice takes the Ace Attorney series to new heights by treading old ground. The breadth of tools available to crack cases and the wealth of character drama keep you entangled--it's genuinely difficult to put down the 3DS in the middle of case, what with such colorful witnesses and piles of complex lies to sift through. This is courtroom drama--and the series--at its finest and most fun.",Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice is a narrative adventure starring beloved defense attorneys Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice.,8
94,Mat Paget,Everyone 10+,7,NHL 17,"Sep 13, 2016"," Last year's NHL 16 marked a return to form for EA's hockey franchise. It reinstated many of the series’ trademark modes that were removed in the transition to current-generation consoles and introduced an on-ice trainer that made the game much more enjoyable. NHL 17 offers modes with some new bells and whistles, but unfortunately, these few additions aren't significant enough to make NHL 17 stand out from the past.  Thankfully, the action on the ice still shines: handling the puck, skating down the ice, and taking that opportune shot is just as great as it was last year. You feel like you have just the right amount of control over the puck, and you're never left wondering why you lost possession, since taking the puck away from an opponent is also precise and fair. Playing goalie is very similar to last year as well, with intuitive controls that make it easy to drop into a butterfly stance, hug the posts, and move from one side of the crease to the other in an attempt to stop those tricky one-timers. Gameplay can once again be accompanied by the augmented on-ice trainer--which displays information on the players and ice, such as face-off suggestions and shooting lanes--to help you learn all of NHL 17's tricks. It continues to be a fantastic tool for learning how to perform certain tasks, such as faceoffs and specific dekes, while also telling you why you succeeded or failed. If you went for the puck too early or late in a face-off, it'll let you know. If you lose a face-off that felt like it was a sure thing, the trainer will alert you as to why it happened and whether your player's skill was lower than his opponent's or it was just a toss-up. This information is indispensable. The in-game training system is also adaptive and will flip certain hints off as you learn new skills--and if you don't want to see the trainer, you can turn it off completely. As someone who last made their way through the trainer more than a year ago however, it quickly got me back up to speed and learning new skills in NHL 17. The rest of the game's user interface has received some big improvements. The menus still look and feel like they’d work best with a touchscreen or a mouse, but navigation is now more responsive. Roster filters are now a lot more instantaneous, as opposed to the sluggish feeling of making your way through the team interface last year. The NHL games always have an immense number of modes and menus, so improvements in navigation are always appreciated. One of this year's marquee single-player modes is Franchise, which replaces last year's Be a GM and adds a bunch of new numbers and menus to tinker with. In addition to cutting deals with free agents and trading for key players, you can raise and lower the price of your stadium's food, schedule promotional nights, and relocate your team to a new city. Changing the prices of popcorn or setting up bobblehead nights is a fun novelty at first, but not for long. Thankfully, NHL 17 allows a fair bit of customization across the game, and this carries into Franchise. Turning off specific elements of this mode allows you to focus on the aspects you want to get involved in, such as cutting a deal on a free agent or trading for a key player. NHL 17 also reintroduces the World Cup of Hockey, which coincides with the tournament of the same name. The World Cup works just like any other mode, where you play as one team and compete against others in a number of games. The difference between this and the regular season or playoff modes is the presentation, with its majestic music and broadcast-worthy camera angles that are only marred by the in-game commentary repeating itself a bit too often. Unfortunately, this is where the presentation starts and ends--if you win the World Cup, you don't get to see your team awarded with the titular trophy. This is confusing and disappointing, since every other mode rewards players with a short video of your team hoisting the appropriate trophy. Whereas most modes have you play as an entire team, Be a Pro narrows the focus to a single player. You create a skater from scratch and take him from the bottom to the top of the NHL by scoring important goals, making big hits, and setting up teammates. It's become a mainstay in the series, but unfortunately, Be a Pro hasn't improved year to year. It's nearly indistinguishable from the experience found in NHL 16 and includes the exact same problems. You can score multiple points a game, but if you don't play a strong defensive game, you could be punished and moved down a line. Scoring a hat trick and getting demoted after the same game is both baffling and frustrating. Single-player modes fulfill a certain need, but hockey’s a team sport, and the EASHL sees you take a single player online to play with a group of other players. This mode lets you take to the ice in any position, as you play hockey, level up, and unlock new customization options for your player and club arena. The unlockable items are a good target to aim for when gaining experience, since your player and arena will look considerably more awesome as you acquire better-looking gear. Hockey Ultimate Team makes a return, and it remains an engaging experience. You open card packs, which contain players of different skill levels depending upon the type of pack you purchase--these can be bought with both in-game currency or real money. You then take these cards and make a roster before taking them into games against real or AI opponents. It's a rewarding experience when you get cards that complement your roster nicely, but spending actual money on a pack and not getting a single usable player is infuriating. It makes you feel like you shouldn't spend money at all--you can rely exclusively on the in-game currency you can grind out by playing the game. Draft Champions is a new addition to the NHL series, and it’s used mainly for earning Hockey Ultimate Team currency. The goal? Win four games in a row against online opponents or the AI with a team you draft from a specific theme, which might focus on players who are from Canada, have won the Stanley Cup, or are relatively new to the NHL. You start with a roster of 20 low-skilled players, and you get 12 rounds to replace them with the best possible skaters. It’s fun to experiment with the strategy of how to draft your team. Do you want to make sure all your bases are covered, or would you prefer to frontload your offense? On top of that, it’s gratifying to actually win with the team you threw together, but online’s the only way to go with this mode. Offline solo play is available, but playing against AI-controlled teams that don't take part in their own draft--and have eight lower-skilled players--is a boring, frustrating experience. NHL 17 is a great game of hockey, but unlike last year, there isn't a standout mode or feature that makes this game substantially better than its predecessor. It rides off a lot of what NHL 16 did, and the new additions don't add anything crucial to the experience. It's still a lot of fun to trade players in Franchise, build a formidable roster in Hockey Ultimate Team, and actually play matches, but if you were hoping NHL 17 would be a significant step forward for the series, you're out of luck.",NHL 17 lets players hit the ice for another season of hockey.,6
95,Alex Gilyadov,Mature,,The Final Station,"Aug 30, 2016"," The Final Station, a side-scrolling shooter set during a zombie apocalypse, bears plenty of similarities to other games that focus on the undead. The are, of course, hordes of undead waiting to pounce, darkened, abandoned areas to explore, and a distinct lack of weapons and ammo to make everything just a little challenging. The premise is familiar, save for your occupation: You’re an ordinary train conductor caught in the middle of a zombie outbreak. You coast around the remains of civilization, exploring infested locales in search of supplies and a means to progress down the tracks, all while zombies nip at your heels. The Final Station primarily distinguishes itself from other zombie-killing games during combat, where action-focused scenes are almost puzzle-like in how you have to find the right strategy to overcome seemingly overwhelming odds with the limited tools you have at your disposal. The zombies you fight aren't pushovers; it only takes them three quick hits to put you down, and they love to attack in pairs. Enemies exhibit specific strengths and weaknesses: for example, you can easily tackle a slow, mid-sized zombie with melee attacks, but smaller, faster monsters require bullets to the head. Because of this, combat remains challenging throughout. You can find and purchase a few weapon upgrades, such as laser scopes, that make your dangerous trek a little more manageable. But to be an efficient and effective combatant, you have to think on your feet when a variety of creeps come your way. During one of the earlier levels, with very little ammo on hand, I had to navigate a sewer containing six enemies. The first few attempts, I instantly wasted all of my ammo on three enemies and kept making a run for it, resulting in my immediate death at the hands of the group’s fastest monster. During my third attempt, I discovered a metal chair tucked away nearby in a hidden room that was deadly enough to decapitate two enemies at once. I used it, along with my shotgun, leaving one lone monster--easy enough to escape. Pull back from combat, however, and the factors that make The Final Station a joy to play are lost behind the repetitious nature of the adventure; there's always a passcode to find in order to reach a new area, which yields an abandoned town to explore and a safe zone where you can catch your breath. These areas give you an opportunity to upgrade your arsenal and chat with other survivors, but the townsfolk you meet stop short of being truly interesting. Try as they might to draw you into the world with idle chitchat, their dialogue doesn't match the gravitas of the highly unusual circumstances they're dealing with. You quickly get the sense that the story’s just a means to an end. In between missions, you're forced to take your train between towns, managing any survivors you may have saved during your journey so far. These rides are the dullest portions of the game. The train only has a few cars, and if you do manage to bring a few survivors on board, you’re tasked with feeding and healing them. But to do so, you only need to pick up a meal from a nearby dispenser and give it to the desired survivor. The train will also break down periodically, with the ventilation system and power often going out. Fixing these issues is simple--all you need to do is spam a few button presses. You're rewarded for every passenger that survives their journey to an intact city, making the rides a little bit bearable. But that’s not enough to make up for these mandatory, tedious treks. Despite the weak connective tissue that ties it all together, The Final Station leaves a positive impression. There are numerous dark and dreamy settings to discover--crumbling, dimly lit caverns, old train tunnels, vividly snowy villages, and flooded towns filled with corpses and garbage floating in water--and almost every encounter forces you to develop and execute a viable strategy, lest you shoot from the hip and end up as zombie food when your ammo runs out. Zombie-based games are a dime a dozen, and while it may seem the theme has run its course, The Final Station is proof that there's life in the undead yet.","Travel by train through a dying world.

96,Tamoor Hussain,Teen,6,ReCore,"Sep 13, 2016"," ReCore feels like a game grappling with insecurity over its length. Clocking in at around eight hours, it's a modest action game in which players, along with robotic companions called CoreBots, explore dungeons to find power-ups and progress through the story. It draws its inspirations from Metroid Prime and aspires to offer the same free-form adventuring, where items and abilities unlock fresh traversal options, and invite players to explore new opportunities in old areas. It also attempts to bake in the hyperactive lock-and-strafe combat of Prime, except from a third-person perspective. And for the most part, it succeeds. Main character Joule has a rifle that can shoot red, yellow, blue, and white lasers that do more damage when they hit a matching enemy. There are other considerations such as bullet spray or a charge shot that staggers targets and breaks through shields. Since enemies come in big groups, crowd control is injected with some dynamism: you're frequently cycling through colors to take out the biggest threat or pick off the pest in the distance. The combat is simple, but the colour system gives the moment-to-moment engagements some intricacy. When you're in the zone and matching colours properly, it's possible to tear through multiple waves of enemies very quickly, and it's quite pleasing. Most enemies are powered by Cores--essentially robot souls--and when enough damage is done, Joule can fire out a line and latch onto these to begin a tug-of-war for ownership. Nabbing a core is like reeling in a fish, where you pull at the opportune moments and ease up when there's too much resistance. It's a thrilling moment of tension in combat scenarios that are already designed to overwhelm. Snatch the Core and you've got some juice to upgrade the attack, defense, or energy of your own CoreBots. Alternatively, you can forgo this and just destroy an enemy to collect scraps, which can be used to make parts for your companions. These have passive bonuses such as improved chances of staggering or quicker ability cooldowns. Joule can have two animal-like CoreBots with her at the same time, and swap them in and out of action. Your robotic allies follow you around everywhere you go and generally attack whatever’s in their path, but can be commanded to execute special attacks. Mack the dog has a tackle, Seth the spider has a barrage of rockets, and Duncan the ape has a ground pound. These abilities are dependent on a cooldown timer, so it's really about picking your moments and synchronising with your own attacks. A CoreBot's Lethal Attack is far more effective if you land a charge shot and stagger the enemy first, the timing isn't difficult to learn and the damage reward is significant. During combat, Joule can call the bot on the battlefield to her side, so there's also an element of strategy to attacking and defending. For example, Duncan can be left to tear up the battlefield since he soaks up damage, but you'll want to keep calling Seth back to you to give him the range he needs to stay safe and be effective. ReCore's missteps are a real shame, because it can be quite charming otherwise...It has the heart of a PS2 or Gamecube-era platformer Joule is very light on her feet, and enemies force you stay mobile with a hail of colored bullets, bombs, and lasers, which can only be avoided with deft leaps and bounds. There are behemoths that will unleash area-of-effect attacks and rhino-like bots that require air dashes and double jumps to escape. At times it can feel like playing an arcade shooter, where you're looking for openings in waves of lasers to thread yourself between, and maneuvering around the environment to find some breathing room. The systems aren't seamlessly connected, flowing into each other as mechanics in Bayonetta or Devil May Cry would, but they support each other to create a very proactive combat style. Together they give you enough plates to spin to make the overall experience chaotic and engaging. The world of ReCore is barren and lacks visual diversity, but there are some small touches that spark the imagination. Its desert landscape is cut with the remnants of a robot workforce, bruised by incomplete terraforming, and scarred by signs of a battle between man and machine. Dungeons are all part-cave, part-underground lab, but given a base coat of fire, ice, or poison, usually represented by stalagmites gripping walls like claws. It's characters are Saturday morning cartoonish, with big eyes and a go-get-em attitude. Joule is an engineer that has woken up from stasis on an alien planet to find the terraforming process has been knocked off track. Her dad is missing and all the worker robots have turned hostile. Despite this, she's chirpy and leaps into challenges head-on, never stopping to reflect on how bad her situation looks. Her companions, the CoreBots, are equally as vivacious. Mack is the best robot dog a gal could ask for. He's made of junk; a rusty old head with one eye, scratched hind legs I found in the desert, and a torso that looks like it was ripped from a junkyard motorcycle. Yet he has the core of an eager pup. His tail wags like a metronome at 200 bpm. He sniffs, circles, barks, and bounds. Even something as insignificant as Cellbots--essentially keys for locks--are brimming with personality. When you dig them out of the ground, they bleep and bloop their appreciation. Their eyes are spaced way too far apart, and they wheeze through an air tube. Imagine a pug crossed with a drone--you can't help but smile at that. Had it been comfortable with its brevity, ReCore could have been a scrappy little shooter, but towards the end of the game it gates progress behind a door that demands you collect 20 Prismatic Cores. Then there's another door requiring 25. Then another asking for 30. And then two more doors beyond that. These Cores are peppered around the vast desert outside, tucked away in mountain crevices or placed atop impossibly high industrial towers. They're marked on a map, but their locations are still maddeningly vague. Enclosed in drab spheres, Prismatic Cores are difficult to discern from all the brown iron beams and black metal sheets that make up ReCore's world. Some are in rocks that Duncan could punch through, but the cracks signalling their locations are lost amongst the dusty mountains and pale sand. Prismatic Cores can also be acquired in extra Arena, Traversal, or Adventure Dungeons, but these are barebones in terms of gameplay. They each have unimaginative sub-objectives--such as finishing within a time limit, shooting a quota of switches, or collecting a hidden key--but they don't force you to rethink the way you use weapons or abilities. It's always run, jump and, shoot. Completing them feels like doing chores for pocket money. Going through these dungeons means shooting the same enemies over and over again with no new challenges. And platforming becomes similarly monotonous. Returning to old areas will score you some decent loot--or a Prismatic Core if you've got the patience to work through the confusing world--but there's little value beyond that. Pushing the player back into the overworld to do side-quests would be understandable if Joule still needed a special skill or weapon to take on a final boss, but that isn't the case. Instead they come off as a fetch quests to artificially extend your adventure. This issue is exasperated by ReCore's lengthy loading screens. I found that, depending on whether I was moving between areas or returning to Joule's homebase--the Crawler--I was sitting through two- to three-minute loading screens. Given how regularly you move between locations--especially when collecting Prismatic Cores for the evil progress-blocking doors--these loading screens are intensely frustrating. At times the spinning loading icon will freeze, leaving you to wonder if the game has crashed altogether. I played on Xbox One, and it crashed four times. Sometimes it would fail to load the map, forcing me to restart the game and sit through even more loading screens. ReCore's missteps are a real shame, because it can be quite charming otherwise. It has the heart of a PS2 or Gamecube-era platformer, with its floating lifebars, bright laser beams that fill the screen like a Dreamcast shoot-'em-up, and glowing gems that bounce around. Amongst all the slick, modern day video game productions, it stands out as an endearing throwback. I wanted to like it more, and had it not overstayed its welcome, I would have. But in the end, like its robots, ReCore is a game with a bright soul encased in parts that are used well past their prime.",The next game from Keiji Inafune and the creators of Metroid Prime.,7.7
97,Scott Butterworth,Teen,3,The Tomorrow Children,"Sep 6, 2016"," Dylan Cuthbert's Q-Games has been a PlayStation mainstay for nearly a decade. Its PixelJunk games were consistently stylish, cohesive, and engaging. In a disappointing contrast, the studio's latest downloadable PlayStation-exclusive, The Tomorrow Children, is a bland, monotonous, inscrutable mess. Though difficult to categorize, the game consists primarily of resource gathering and city building, with some floaty platforming and clumsy combat filling the gaps in between. While that might sound a bit like Minecraft, the two games differ drastically in both their overall tone and their fundamental approach to gameplay. Where Minecraft allows for and even incentivizes creativity, Tomorrow Children locks you into a tedious, time-draining loop that never amounts to a larger payoff. And worse still, it fails to explain many of its convoluted gameplay systems, leaving you to flounder for the first hour and periodically exclaim, ""So that's what that's for?"" every few hours after that. The opening tutorial at least explains the absolute basics: Following a failed global experiment, all that remains of our world is The Void, a vast, empty space dotted with disconnected towns, a handful of marauding monsters, and resource-rich ""islands"" that randomly appear in the nothingness. Your character is one of an army of identical ""projections"" that serve as the worker drones of the Soviet-themed society. And though the tutorial skips this part, each projection is controlled by another human player. For some reason, you'll only catch brief, ethereal glimpses of other players rather than simply playing alongside them at all times, but you'll feel their presence as your resource counts fluctuate and new buildings pop up in your shared town. The tutorial also doesn't cover what you're supposed to do in Tomorrow Children, let alone how or why. As much as resource-gathering sounds like it would be self-evident, you're denied basic information like where to buy mining tools and how to reach islands so you can put those tools to use. Games aren't obligated to hold your hand, but Tomorrow Children isn't playing coy in service of some grander mystery like, say, The Witness. It just forces you to slog your way through early frustration for no discernable reason. And once you fight through that fog of frustration, the game that comes into focus isn't any more welcoming. For example, resource-gathering constitutes the single largest portion of the moment-to-moment gameplay, but every single step in the process is excruciatingly tedious. First, you must travel from your town to the one currently available island. But you can't run there because projections sink through the quicksand-like floor of the Void. Instead, you have to wait for the bus. You cannot call the bus; it runs on a preset schedule. So you have to wait. And there is only one bus. If you wander up as it's pulling away, too bad. You just have to wait for it to return, which will likely take a few minutes. And even once you board the bus, you can't skip the ride. If you hate unskippable cutscenes, imagine an unskippable bus ride through a blank white abyss. You can eventually bribe your way into a vehicle licence (another poorly explained aspect of the game), but driving isn't much better. You no longer have to wait, but holding R2 as you cross a straight, flat surface is about as exciting as watching paint dry. If you're extremely lucky, the island will appear close enough to your town that you can conjure a bridge using a purchased ""Void Power,"" but those situations are, sadly, quite rare. Once you actually reach the island, you can start to break its odd, destructible environments down into resources. Unfortunately, you're at the mercy of your tools. See, the black market pickaxe you can purchase using real-world cash is, according to the menu text, 15.5 times faster than the basic pickaxe you can purchase using earned in-game currency. With the basic pickaxe, you hit a button once, then wait as your projection hammers away and a meter slowly fills. It's painful, especially considering all tools--even those for-purchase tools--break over time. In fairness, the $20 Founders Pack version of the game (as opposed to the upcoming free-to-play edition) starts you with a moderate cash injection, and you'll discover cash randomly strewn around the world as well. But even with this bonus cash, your supply will inevitably run out, and when it does, you'll either have to endure some microtransactions or claw your eyes out in boredom since this is just one of the many, many instances where the game prompts you to spend real money to save time. Regardless of what you use to mine for resources, you'll ultimately achieve the same end result: raw materials that you have to drag from their spot on the island back to the bus stop. The problem this time is your backpack: it contains just three pockets for resources, meaning you can only transport four chunks of material at time if you hold the fourth in your hands. This results in endless unavoidable backtracking that is utterly mindless and repetitive. You can eventually earn a fourth pocket, but needless to say, it doesn't help much. Then, naturally, you have to wait for the bus to return before manually hauling all the resources from the return bus stop to their individual piles further into town--yet another tiresome, empty process that could have easily been automated. The islands themselves can be visually intriguing and even fun to explore, but that's nowhere near enough to compensate for the mind-numbing, time-devouring resource collection loop. Of course, all that resource gathering is in service of the game's other major gameplay pillar: crafting. If the city-building portion of Tomorrow Children was brilliant and rewarding, maybe--just maybe--all that tedious mining and moving and piling would feel worthwhile. Unfortunately, it's not. At all. In spite its labyrinthine menus and the deluge of indecipherable town stats, there's actually not much depth or strategy to the building. Basically every town you could possibly find yourself in will already have most of its essential infrastructure, so at best, you'll need to add a power plant or maybe a new apartment complex or a turret. The crafting table simply doesn't offer many options that are actually worth building, which stymies any strategy that might have emerged from this portion of the game. Plus, even if you know exactly what you need to build, there's a always a chance you won't be able to. Islands contain a random assortment of resources; more than once, I desperately needed metal but could only find crystal and coal. When that happened, I could only wait for the next island to spawn. Even the act of crafting isn't enjoyable. Basically, you approach the town's lone crafting station and, assuming you have the requisite resources and that no other player is using the station at that time, select what you want to build from the preset menu (which does not seem to grow or change as you level up). At that point, you're forced to solve a tile-sliding puzzle. Oh, but don't worry, you can use your real-world cash to solve the puzzle instantly if you don't feel like pushing numbered tiles around a grid-based board until they all appear in numerical order. Outside of crafting, town's also teem with civics-related stats and gameplay systems, including ""elections"" that allow players to buff different portions of the town's basic operations based on their chosen leader's platform. I was pretty flustered trying to understand all the nuances until I realized none of these ancillary systems had any material impact on my experience. Elections, leveling perks, my town's technology rating--their menus explained the numerical implications of each one, but I never actually felt that impact while playing the game. I also never felt attached to my town in any way. Games like Minecraft and Stardew Valley allow you to develop a sense of ownership over your creations because your decisions directly shape every little detail. But remember, in Tomorrow Children, you're building a town with online strangers with whom you cannot communicate. As a result, town's develop haphazard layouts that are difficult to navigate much less take pride in. Worse still, your individual contributions are sometimes rendered meaningless. For example, I once logged back into the game after just a few hours away, and when I returned to the town I'd been working on, I received a prompt that read: ""The restoration of this town is complete."" Apparently the other members of my town had done enough building and gathering to finish what we'd started together. Needless to say, getting booted back to a menu and being told to pick a new town didn't exactly fill me with a deep sense of accomplishment. If nothing else, the game's Soviet style is certainly novel. From its creepy doll-faced characters to its patriotic propaganda, Tomorrow Children certainly makes the most of its chosen motif. Unfortunately, that motif is much cooler on paper than in practice. Propaganda is designed to beat you down and break your spirit, so it's no surprise being surrounding by it for hours at a time is actually pretty unpleasant. After hearing the same Soviet march blare at me from a teleprompter for the hundredth time, I was more than ready to leave that world forever. I simply did not want to spend time there. It also didn't help that Tomorrow Children suffers from persistent, noticeable technical problems. Objects routinely clip through each other. In one instance, I saw two vehicles become entwined and rendered unusable. They just sat idling in a heap in the middle of town. At another point, I actually got trapped on a bus. I could swivel the camera into the back of my own head, but I couldn't actually disembark. And while this might have been a deliberate aesthetic choice, many objects in the world are so shiny they almost appear greasy. The lighting is impressive in many instances but rarely necessary. Frankly, however, technical problems are the least of Tomorrow Children's troubles. The resource gathering is tedious, the crafting is superficial, town management is convoluted, microtransactions are practically inescapable, and the world is unwelcoming and empty. In short: The individual components aren't enjoyable, and they don't contribute to anything bigger. There is no payoff. There is no point.","When an ambitious experiment designed to unite the minds of all humanity goes horribly wrong, almost all life on Earth disappears instantly, melting down into the planet to form “the Void”.

98,Heidi Kemps,Mature,9,Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse,"Sep 20, 2016"," At first blush, Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse may look like a reconfigured version of 2013's Shin Megami Tensei IV, but that belies its complexities. It’s practically an entirely new adventure that comes with a host of enhancements to core gameplay and character progression. The result? An incredible RPG that surpasses its lofty predecessor in almost every way. Nanashi and Asahi might not be related by blood, but they’ve formed a familial bond as two young would-be Hunters in post-apocalyptic Tokyo. Hunters help the populace by battling and taming demonic hordes that exist above ground in the city’s now-eternal night. They also serve as a lifeline for humanity, helping people forage and survive in the midst of a supernatural conflict between the hellish forces of Lucifer and the almighty angels of Merkabah. Since Apocalypse’s story runs concurrent to Shin Megami Tensei IV’s Neutral Path storyline, folks who have played the original will see events and characters from a different perspective--that of the people living in what remains of Tokyo. While it helps to have some familiarity with the original, the game’s starting events ramp up so quickly that you're immediately engaged with the story at hand. While Shin Megami Tensei IV makes you slog through the dull-as-dirt setting of Mikado before you get to see the far more interesting demonic Tokyo, Apocalypse puts you right in the middle of the perpetually dark megacity, where all the interesting events and plot development take place. Apocalypse’s amazing sense of visual design manages to create a terrifying-yet-beautiful vision of a ruined metropolis. You explore fallen structures and landmarks, forage through rotten train stations, high-end shopping centers, and parks to find scraps of the old world to pawn for cash. The demons that roam and attack passersby are a mix of iconic Shin Megami Tensei designs and all-new art, some of which is particularly awe-inspiring--you know you're in trouble when you encounter a giant, makeup-smeared donkey-headed creature with a ripped torso and a peacock tail. Beyond the story and setting, however, Apocalypse makes a host of improvements to its core gameplay that immensely improves the experience of demon hunting and exploration--save for the map, which is still as difficult to discern as it was in Shin Megami Tensei IV. For starters, the simple act of receiving new quests is now mostly automated. Instead of having to report back to a hub, quests are automatically delivered to Nanashi’s cell phone, and registered as complete when he accomplishes their goal; an elegant way to streamline the questing process. In addition, all of the game’s difficulty settings are unlocked from the get-go, and you can freely switch between them instead of forcing your way through a demoralizing cycle of deaths to access the easy difficulty setting. Beyond the story and setting, however, Apocalypse makes a host of improvements to its core gameplay that immensely improves the experience of demon hunting and exploration--save for the map, which is still as difficult to discern as it was in Shin Megami Tensei IV. Demon recruiting and fusion, a crucial component to the core Shin Megami Tensei games, also sees an interesting overhaul. Certain demon types that were once impossible to recruit through normal means can now be invited to join via the in-battle Scout command, and they have new conversation trees to explore. There’s also a brand-new element introduced where demons receive additional, innate buffs or debuffs to particular skill types, which needs to be taken into account when fusing demons to create new variations. For example, a primarily magic-damage-focused demon may have innate penalties on physical skills, but they get a bonus damage or MP reduction effect on electric and healing techniques. This is something you need to take into consideration when picking which skills to pass on to demons that result from fusions. Sure, you can make a Jack Frost with fire skills, but when it’s got an innate damage-dealt penalty on fire skills, wouldn’t that skill slot be better used for something it’s actually good at? Combat itself benefits from improvements, too. While the engine is the same turn-based Press Turn system seen across several SMT games, two additions make a big difference in Apocalypse. The first seems minor at first: an overhaul to the Smirk status. By scoring critical hits and/or hitting an opponent’s weakness, a character or demon can score an extra turn in battle and potentially trigger the Smirk status, which negates that character’s own weakness while guaranteeing a critical hit on the next turn. In Apocalypse, however, Smirk can also grant normal skills a guaranteed additional effect, such as status debuffs or instant kills. Smirk was already crucial in Shin Megami Tensei IV, but intelligent use of it in Apocalypse makes battling a lot more efficient in the long run. Everything about Apocalypse looks, feels, and sounds great; the excellent soundtrack works to enhance the feelings of exploration in a darkened, destroyed world. All of the gameplay additions improve elements where the original Shin Megami Tensei IV was lacking. The other (more visibly important) addition is the partner system. A bevy of partners join you over the course of the game, including your friend Asahi, a kid from the Yakuza, a woman with the powers of a fairy queen, and the reincarnation of SMT4's obnoxious heel, Navarre. One character can be assigned as a partner, and they’ll join you in combat, attacking and providing backup under AI control. Partners can be targeted and damaged by enemies just like a normal party member, but since they’re not on the front lines, they can’t be targeted by several skills--a reality that's both detrimental and beneficial. Each partner specializes in different skills, such as buffs, healing, or direct damage, so picking the right partner for the right battles is crucial. After they’ve fought for a certain amount of turns, your team comes together for an all-out attack, using their combined skills while teaming up to deliver big damage and cancel an enemy’s turn entirely, making them invaluable for extensive boss fights. Everything about Apocalypse looks, feels, and sounds great; the excellent soundtrack works to enhance the feelings of exploration in a darkened, destroyed world. Your demonic servants roar, cry, and yell in the heat of battle, making combat feel more lively and risky than ever before. All of the gameplay additions improve elements where the original Shin Megami Tensei IV was lacking. Meanwhile, the story’s eagerness to get into the heat of the new conflict makes it quick and easy for you to become caught up in this bewildering, dangerous world where humans, gods, and demons coexist. Apocalypse is a fantastic RPG that goes above and beyond the original Shin Megami Tensei IV to become one of the shining gems of the 3DS library.",The story of Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse is one of human pawns being shuffled across a chessboard by the higher deities.,8.8
99,Jason D'Aprile,Everyone 10+,8,Worms W.M.D,"Aug 23, 2016"," Team17’s Worms series has been happily bumping along since the mid-'90s with no signs of stopping. Despite some absurd spin-offs and missteps, the franchise’s tried-and-true turn-based, scorched-earth-style formula has allowed Worms to become one of the most consistently entertaining series around. The latest game, Worms W.M.D., is an excellent example of why Worms continues to thrive, and why it's original formula had the right idea all along. If you’ve never played a Worms game before, the concept is simple: opposing teams of well-armed worm commandos face off in a turn-based battle in a completely destructible 2D landscape. Physics play a key role; gravity, acceleration, charging power, and even wind direction affect the huge array of weaponry. The old standby bazooka, which you can charge to adjust its range and power, is still the default weapon, but exploding sheep, airstrikes, a variety of grenades, melee weapons, the dragon punch, and more are up for grabs. Jetpacks, the ninja rope, teleporters, and other vital tools are at your disposal for traversing the landscape. But no matter what you choose, you still have a limited amount of time to perform any action. Airdrops keep more supplies coming. Some of these actually deliver parts instead of complete weapons or power-ups and are used for crafting--a new wrinkle to the series. It’s not a sea change, but the ability to make new weapons and supplies (even during an opponent’s turn) can occasionally help turn the tide of a battle. W.M.D. adds two other major facets that make considerably more impact. The first is the inclusion of vehicles. Tanks and helicopters appear on some levels and greatly change the dynamic of the action for the brief period of time they’re in use. Tanks, in particular, provide exceptional protection and firepower to chew through the terrain and other worms with a multi-shell attack. Meanwhile, the helicopter has a killer mini-gun assault and is comically awkward to control and aim. There are even mounted guns to be had, which provide ample firepower but can also leave your worm incredibly exposed. Worms isn’t, in any way, a “driving” game, but these new elements feel like natural additions. Aiming the tank gun or helicopter is far from a sure thing most of the time, and these vehicles don’t feel so overpowered that a normal worm can’t destroy them. Using the left stick for both moving and aiming, however, makes the controls feel a little finicky on consoles, since it’s easy to accidently move when simply trying to line a shot up using the analog stick. The other interesting addition comes in the form of structures. You can actually enter houses, barns, pubs, bunkers, and other buildings now. They frequently hide goodies like supplies and vehicles, and buildings can also provide invaluable protection from attacks and add much more compelling reasons to explore the map. At times, enemy worms can be hiding in a structure without you even realizing it, leading to extra reasons to destroy more parts of the map. Given that you stand to benefit from surveying the map, it's unfortunate that W.M.D.’s camera feels unreliable at times. Even when you take manual control, the game has a tendency to just whip the screen back to a less-than-optimal spot. As a result, you regularly fight with the camera when you try to take in all the action or focus on a specific worm. It’s by no means a game-breaking problem, but it’s certainly in need of refinement. Typical of the series, W.M.D. offers an array of single-player levels that cover all aspects of the game. Unlike recent entries into the series, however, there’s no underlying plot thread or story. Instead, the single-player game feels like an extended tutorial. Playing through various offline modes unlocks new ways to customize your worm team--voices, skins, clothing items, and so on--and there are tutorial maps, themed campaigns, and special challenge maps. Playing Worms against an AI-controlled opponent is still tons of fun, but there’s something intrinsically entertaining about mixing the hilarious graphics, audio, and action of Worms with multiplayer. So, whether your opponent annihilates your worms with expert finesse or totally crashes and burns during their turn, the game is almost always fascinating just to watch. Online play can support up to six players in ranked or friendly matches. While there isn’t much variety in terms of game modes (it’s pretty much all worm-versus-worm), Worms W.M.D. is a great reminder of how far humor and sheer wanton destruction can carry a game. Which is to say, it’s still terrifically fun after more than 20 years. W.M.D. is easily the best game in the Worms series in several years. It stays true to the 2D, animated roots of the ’90s games while adding enough new features to keep it feeling fresh and relevant. The relatively simple gameplay is overflowing with finesse and strategy, the presentation is fantastic, and offline or on, Worms is just incredibly fun.","Worms WMD features a fresh, brand new look 2D cartoon-inspired worm as well as gorgeous hand drawn landscapes.",8.7
100,Jason D'Aprile,Everyone,8,Pac-Man Championship Edition 2,"Sep 13, 2016"," It’s always a risky proposition to take a beloved classic franchise and move it forward with added twists. Change too much, and a reimagined retro game can lose its nostalgic charm. Don’t change enough, and players might not see the point at all. Bandai Namco has been toeing this razor-thin line with Pac-Man for quite a few years, but with good results. In 2007, Pac-Man: Championship Edition bolstered the series' simple maze template with different modes, challenges, map configurations, and eye-catching effects--and the result was one of the best arcade revamps ever made. Fast-forward nine years, and Bandai Namco has successfully rejuvenated Pac-Man once again in Pac-Man: Championship Edition 2. It’s so overhauled, in fact, that it uses a progression meter to unlock new modes--starting with a tutorial. Who’d have thought that a Pac-Man game would need instructions? Yet Championship Edition 2 definitely does. Rather than merely teach you how to play, it also serves as a quick trip down the road of game design to see how developers can successfully evolve a game from 1980. The first major enhancement comes courtesy of Pac-Man’s relationship with the ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. Pac-Man can touch them now, after decades of doing his best to avoid making contact. Even though you won't outright die if you bump into a ghost, it can still have dangerous side effects--and after the third bump, the ghosts will doggedly chase down Pac-Man and kill him on contact. The game includes sleeping ghosts as well, who wake up when Pac-Man gets near and immediately rush to join their leader. The veritable trains that form after waking up multiple ghosts are vital for achieving high scores, because when Pac-Man eats the power pill that allows him to devour weakened spirits, he can gobble up multiple ghosts in quick succession. When it's time to feast on the dead, the game switches to a cinematic 3D view, allowing you revel in your success in style. Boss battles are also included now--but done in proper Pac-Man style. You don’t attack a boss directly, since they float above and below the board (they’re usually massive ghosts made up of hundreds of blocks). Instead, you fight through a series of maps by collecting every last piece of fruit. On the final stage, Pac-Man must eat enough dots to make a power pill appear. The resulting mayhem isn’t quite as interactive as it could be--the power pill merely kicks off a cutscene where Pac-Man devours the boss on his own. The final twists are bombs and bomb jumps. Essentially, if Pac-Man gets himself into a tight spot, a quick button press will send him back to his starting point. This is important, because Pac must tactically change course sometimes in order to evade ghosts or catch floating fruit that runs away from him. The first Championship Edition was a triumph of style, and the same can be said here. The classic Pac-Man theme is present and accounted for--remixed and enhanced like everything else--and the overall presentation is terrific. All these elements come together across the game's many levels to create an experience that’s still absolutely Pac-Man but advanced in ways that make it far more interesting and strategic. Pac-Man: Championship Edition 2 creates an exciting dynamic where ghosts are still dangerous, but the overall game is more forgiving than the original--and it’s more entertaining as a result. Arcade ports tend to be games we play in short bursts--mostly for the nostalgia factor. Pac-Man: Championship Edition 2 certainly relies on that nostalgia to a point, but it handles the classic game in a way that plays with expectations to surprise you. It’s the same game enhanced in the right directions to be make an old concept fun, innovative, and challenging all over again.","A new sequel in the highly acclaimed PAC-MAN Championship Edition series finally comes to next-generation consoles and PC! Taking highlights from the past, PAC-MAN Championship Edition 2 takes the best aspects from Championship Edition and Championship Edition DX and evolves the game for the future! Featuring eye-popping 3D graphics and funky visuals, the latest version of the classic game takes chomping and chasing through mazes to a whole new level! Get on the train, a new PAC experience is coming!",9
101,Daniel Starkey,Everyone 10+,8,RIVE,"Sep 13, 2016"," Backed into a corner by curtains of laser fire, I hop and twist, curling my shots and grinding foes into nuts and bolts. After hacking a support drone to bring in some extra muscle to the fight, I battle my way out and continue my maelstrom of destruction. These moments are common in Rive, and they're emblematic of how the game melds sharp design and challenging encounters to reinvigorate the shoot-em-up genre. It's a chaotic game backed by explosive action, snarky cracks, and an affection for the ridiculous. You play as a no-name, space-salvaging badass in a robust spider tank. It’s an armored, all-terrain machine with a giant machine gun for its basic weapon. As you progress, you’ll earn more upgrades like new weapons and armor, plus some gadgets that let you take control of everything from turrets to trains. In the beginning, you stumble across a gargantuan derelict vessel ready for plunder. But, of course, there's a catch: As you explore, you’re accosted by countless drones and bots programmed to put you down. You'll learn to shoot, move, and use some other basic skills, but then Rive situationally limits how can use your newfound abilities by forcing you into a corner or into a zero-g bubble. These moments are as tense as boss battles, asking you to utilize your skills in novel ways, all while under the duress of constant, high-energy action. Despite that, Rive rarely feels overwhelming. It's intense and taxing, but it doesn't often feel like it's asking too much. It's common nowadays to herald difficult games as intrinsically “good,” but that trend belies that fact that there's a tenuous balance between difficulty and frustration. Rive is challenging, but even if you die, you can instantly jump back into the action. You never lose more than about 30 seconds of progress, and death doesn't drain resources or knock down your overall score. The game includes plenty of tough spots, but it doesn’t take too long to acclimate to the challenge and wriggle through. Along the way, you'll find some rather strange locales, given that the majority of the game takes place on a spaceship. Between giant lava lakes, oceans, zero-G bubbles, and the like, Rive gives you plenty of playgrounds to explore. Each area is bright, colorful and gorgeously animated. Creatures skitter along the floor while lights and backgrounds hum with life. That's all window dressing, sure, but each level is also distinct, presenting new sets of challenges every few minutes. One of the few solid knocks against Rive comes from its protagonist. He's got all the corn and cheese of classics like Duke Nukem (without the crass misogyny). He has all the personality of a brick, and only a couple of his jokes hit their mark. It's a strange addition that doesn't seem necessary given the game's focus on action over storytelling, and is borderline cringeworthy. Rive is demanding, but it pushes the kind of near-thoughtless play that shoot-em-ups strive to achieve. When faced with an onslaught of enemies and environmental hazards, you'll have to think fast or die. Rive also doesn't run all that long, but what's here is excellent, top-notch action, and the game delivers some of the most memorable moments in a shoot-em-up in years.  ","RIVE - the metal wrecking, robot hacking shooter - is a game with old school gaming values in a decidedly new school execution. During RIVE's intense 360 degree shooting and platforming action, players learn to alter the behavior of their robotic enemies by collecting and uploading hacks.",8
102,Tamoor Hussain,Mature,6,Batman: The Telltale Series,"Aug 2, 2016"," The final moments of Batman - The Telltale Series: Episode One posed an interesting question: What happens to Bruce Wayne when the core beliefs that guide him are undermined? Episode Two: Children of Arkham feints at answering this, but shifts its focus to establishing a villain instead. It’s an episode that has some unexpected moments, but ultimately feels less ambitious with its narrative than its predecessor. Although Bruce and his crime-fighting alter ego might get the most screen time, Oswald Cobblepot is the focal point of this episode. Oz was a childhood friend of Bruce’s, but his family fell on hard times, so he fled Gotham and turned to a life of crime. Upon his return he spoke of an impending revolution. The sparks of that revolution ignite in episode two. Telltale does a good job of presenting Oswald as a complicated character. His actions are undoubtedly villainous--which shouldn't come as a surprise, given he is the Penguin--but revelations about the downfall of the Cobblepots begets Oz some well-deserved sympathy. You’ll never quite root for him over Batman, but when his justifications are revealed it becomes easier to understand what’s driving him. Despite this, Penguin isn’t charismatic as a villain. He schemes and grandstands, but it’s never in a way that’s thrilling to watch. Thankfully, episode two alludes to there being a bigger, badder villain behind the scenes. Episode two is also about Bruce Wayne's father, Thomas Wayne, whose deepest, darkest secrets are laid bare for all to see. What you learn about him would be more shocking if TV show Gotham hadn’t just used a very similar plot, so in that respect Telltale’s series isn’t treading new ground, but it does place Bruce in a much harsher light. As a result, the dynamics of some of his relationships change. For Harvey Dent, who was banking on the wholesome Wayne name to propel his mayoral campaign, his friendship with Bruce becomes a liability. There’s a growing tension between the two characters, which Telltale effectively harnesses when asking you to make decisions. It creates situations where lashing out at Harvey would be understandable, but knowing it could have big consequences going forward may stay your hand. The shift in Bruce’s relationship with Alfred, meanwhile, is more subtle. In episode one, Alfred is the voice of dissent. He repeatedly warns Bruce about being Batman and dissuades him from his vigilante activities. However, after some hard truths about Alfred are exposed, he changes his tune slightly. He’s more supportive, even telling Bruce that the city “needs” Batman. This could simply be because he needs to show faith in Batman so Bruce can deal with the dangers facing Gotham. But given what Bruce learns about him, it also feels like Alfred is trying to recover some lost respect. Or perhaps he’s seeing the Wayne identity being corroded and is pushing Bruce into seeking solace in a new persona. For the most part Telltale’s Alfred embodies the faithful butler archetype, but there are shades of something more there which I hope are explored further. Unfortunately, there [aren't many] memorable moments that make you feel like the World's Greatest Detective The results of your decisions in episode one also start to reveal themselves in Children of Arkham, but none are significant. It’s mostly whether you’re friendly with Vicki Vale or Jim Gordon, based on who you turned the evidence over to in the last episode. Or what Gotham thinks of Batman after the confrontation with Carmine Falcone. If Telltale’s previous games are any indications, these are all part of larger web of consequences the studio is spinning, and episode two adds a few more threads: do you interrogate a prominent Gothamite as Batman, which is the path of least resistance, but could turn the city against you. Or do you use Bruce Wayne’s guile, which is tougher but will keep Jim Gordon on your side. Both of these will no doubt have a knock-on effects, but they’re not decisions to fret over. In fact, there’s really only one moment in episode two that will give you pause. I played through the game twice and the first time around the result of my choice in that moment felt inconsequential. The second time, however, the impact of my decision was profound, so I'd recommend switching to another save slot and experiencing both branches of the story. Other than this moment, episode two is made up of a series of small choices that, while bereft of weight in the moment, also feel like dominoes being stacked next to each other. While Children of Arkham pushes the story forward, it takes a step back in gameplay. The crime-scene investigation which was key to making Telltale’s game feel like a well-rounded Batman experience is missing from episode two. This time around, there’s no mystery to unravel, as all the investigations are simply a matter of clicking a series of interaction points. At the start of the episode Bruce returns to Crime Alley to find a new angle on the murder of his parents. Given our experience picking apart a simulated crime scene in the past, the fact that there’s no puzzle to solve here is a real wasted opportunity. Instead we get yet another straight retelling of the Wayne murder with some commentary from Bruce. The closest episode two gets to making you feel like a detective is when you have to triangulate a phone signal, which involves moving a drone around a map until an on-screen indicator goes green--hardly detective work. Unfortunately, there are no other memorable moments that’ll make you feel like the World's Greatest Detective. This is a shame, because the crime scene investigation in episode one was a satisfying way of mixing the tropes of a point-and-click adventure game while staying true to Batman as a character. The puzzle-like combat sequence from episode one makes a return. During a debate between Harvey Dent and incumbent mayor Hamilton Hill, Batman and Catwoman team up to bring down a squad of armed thugs. You have to study your targets, identify potential weapons in your environment, and execute a series of attacks. This is still a clever way to represent Batman’s foresight and battle prowess, but without the crime scene investigation--and amongst all the QTE sections--it also serves to highlight the lack of gameplay variety in episode two. Anyone expecting Telltale to continue deconstructing Bruce Wayne and his alter ego will come away from Children of Arkham unsatisfied. It effectively lays the groundwork for future events with the help of a few unexpected twists, but in leaving out meaningful detective work, it falls short of the series' first episode.  ","Enter the fractured pysche of Bruce Wayne in this dark and violent new story from the award-winning creators of The Walking Dead - A Telltale Games Series. Batman - The Telltale Series comes to retail as a Season Pass Disc, which includes Episode One, and grants access to the remaining four episodes in the season as they become available to download. The Season Pass Disc will give you access to a total of 5 episodes as they become available.",7.2
103,Miguel Concepcion,Everyone,9,Forza Horizon 3,"Sep 23, 2016"," Update: We've updated our review to reflect the PC version of Forza Horizon 3. Please scroll to the bottom of the story to find the updated content. - PB, 9/27/2016, 10:40 AM PDT However sacrilegious, the ability to launch a Jaguar over a hill and into a cornfield with no risk of mechanical damage is one of the reasons why Forza Horizon 3 is such a blast. As with every well-made open world, Horizon’s lands are rife with distractions; in this semi-fictionalized setting of Australia's Pacific coast, every mile between you and your presumptive waypoint can feature dozens of detours. Before you know it, you’re up five levels, 1 million credits richer, and you still haven’t arrived at the music festival that you meant to reach an hour ago. Developer Playground Games expands upon the previous game's regional hubs--glorified garages and showrooms to buy new cars--and turns them into their own festivals. Imagine a multi-stage music gathering like Coachella or Glastonbury, except you have to drive five miles to get to the closest tent. Sure, it’s unrealistic, but so is this series’ conceptual marriage of music and cars. To fit new fans, your handler, Keira, advises you to expand your festivals from time to time. Doing so unlocks more driving events in a festival’s respective region. Whereas the last Forza Horizon’s main campaign path was the completion of tournaments (and is still a substantial mode this time around), there’s a new emphasis on gaining followers in order to open up more events. A single region can offer at least 50 activities by the time you’ve maxed out its potential. Combine all four regions, and you have a campaign that rivals Burnout Paradise's generous to-do list. Many racing games in the last decade have cleverly crafted single-player narratives around building the player’s reputation. This has been used to attract fictional rivals and grow an imaginary fan base, the latter being the crux of Forza Horizon 3's main path. It takes the reputation game to its next evolutionary step with a lesson in Branding 101. Without blatantly using the term “influencer,” some of the most effective fan-growing events are themed on positive public relations. No joke--these sections are actually called “PR Stunts.” Once you finish rolling your eyes and accept that it’s a sign of the times, you can look beyond the propagandist window dressing and simply focus on the objectives, such as stringing together stunts or executing a single vehicular feat. Like Forza Motorsport, Forza Horizon 3’s point-to-point or circuit competitions are never bereft of split-second moments of gratification, whether it’s shaving off a tenth of a second through drafting or executing a sublime drift. Placing first is, of course, the traditional goal, but you can’t underestimate the thrill of making a clean pass against a competitor, even if it’s to avoid placing last. Forza Horizon 3 transcends the genre’s classic reward designs by pummelling you with dopamine hits well beyond the 12-car races. It’s not unheard of to gain a level, unlock a perk, expand a festival, and obtain a new car in the span of seconds. This can occur at any time, whether you’ve just completed a championship or simply avoided traffic while jetting down the highway. This is what happens when you add a fame-based component to an already robust reward system that includes the previous games’ level progression and skill trees that recognize risky behavior. It’s especially compelling if you can get a well-rounded car into a vineyard and spend the next 30 minutes laying waste to grape plantations with e-brake drifts to earn skill points. The skill tree has tripled in size for this Australian excursion. Along with the perks that enhance the ability to get more perks (e.g., improved skill point multipliers, longer skill point chains), you can purchase XP and earn bonuses that ultimately lead to new cars. Forza Horizon is known for taking sensible liberties in its real-world locations. In Forza Horizon 3’s case, that means being able to drive from Surfers Paradise to Byron Bay in 90 seconds, normally a little over a one-hour drive. Real-world locales like the Kiewa Valley and the Twelve Apostles also litter this eastern region of Oz. It’s a pleasingly subdued version of Australia rather than a caricature of it. There’s no risk of hitting kangaroos, and the local hosts don’t spout slang in every line of dialogue. There’s a generous helping of lush forests and open fields set to the often-gorgeous backdrops of weather and day/night cycles. Those who miss the Out Run-inspired coasts of Italy and the French Riviera of Forza Horizon 2 also get an adequate stretch of shoreline. In short, you won’t ever run out of photo opportunities. After Colorado and Mediterranean Europe in the first and second games respectively, the shift to Australia is fitting for a driving series that has now made room for more off-road competitions. You have to think 50 yards ahead when planning a dirt jump in a Hummer-like Lamborghini LM002. Your landing, however bumpy or misplaced, can mean the difference between maintaining the lead or fighting to escape last place. The natural unpredictability of off-road driving is a stimulating accompaniment to the more structured asphalt races. Forza’s three-year-old Drivatar system has proven itself as a viable alternative to traditional catch-up or rubber-band AI. Supplanting generic names with those of your friends and their driving behaviors puts a spin on asynchronous multiplayer. What’s surprising about Forza Horizon 3 is the wealth of social options without your friends’ real-time presence. Familiar features like leaderboards and clubs are now joined with modes that let you curate your own shareable championships and special events using templates. These forms of asynchronicity are so persistent--including the option to race a friend’s Drivatar during freeroam--that it’s sometimes easy to ignore Forza Horizon’s 3’s online component, despite the return of King and Infected modes, as well as a capture-the-flag-style mode called Flag Rush. For the most part, they’re worth trying out, if only to help friends (and yourself) knock off campaign objectives. The trade-off? Races and adversarial modes can feel like a hassle at the first sign of rubber-banding or lag, which was evident during a number of pre-release online sessions. For a game series that associates itself with ever-popular music festivals, it would be an embarrassment if there wasn't a kickass music playlist, and Forza Horizon 3 doesn’t disappoint. The return of Chvrches’, a band that stood out in Forza Horizon 2, accentuates the near-utopic vibe of this spin-off series. Some events have their own pre-chosen song to fit a given moment. It’s hard to beat listening to Richard Wagner while making an epic 500 foot leap into a gorge or hearing Night on Bald Mountain when racing to a haunted house. And thanks to Crazy Taxi, listening to the Offspring during a timed driving contest makes for a sweet trip down memory lane. The PC version of Forza Horizon 3 benefits from being able to adjust myriad visual options; you have flexibility in optimizing things like lighting, detail, and anti-aliasing. It can be a demanding game, but even a three-year old Razer Blade laptop can run Forza Horizon 3 with performance on par with the console version. High-end graphics cards let you experience Forza Horizon 3 at speeds beyond the Xbox One version’s 30 frames per second, complemented with vibrant lighting and smoother blur effects. It’s not enough to make me regret spending my first 25 hours on Xbox One, but it’s conceivable that the rest of my treks around Playground’s vision of Australia will be exclusively on PC. With Forza Horizon 3, Turn 10 and Playground Games affirm the series’ status as the driving game for everyone. The new emphasis on off-road options isn’t at the expense of traditional races, thanks to the sheer volume of activities. All the while, Playground Games’ calculated kitchen-sink design philosophy and rich reward system persistently tempt you to explore beyond your comfort zone, whether it’s gifting your first Ariel Nomad buggy or reminding you that stunt races can impress thousands of fans. Enhancing your own brand might feel like a strange motivation to hit the road, but pulling off sick e-drifts on a mile-long series of curves makes the PR work worthwhile.","You’re in charge of the Horizon Festival.

104,Miguel Concepcion,Teen,8,God Eater 2,"Nov 14, 2013"," These days, it's easy to find games that let you exterminate fantastic beasts with giant blades and panache. Yet not all those experiences deliver the immediacy of prey hunting with cooperative play quite like God Eater 2: Rage Burst. It makes up for its lack of difficulty and recycled maps with a robust combat system and a wealth of loot to sort through and manage in between matches. Much like the best of Monster Hunter, Rage Burst reaffirms that an online action RPG can rely on a single objective type, as long as that objective is to triumph over hostile creatures. Set three years after the post-apocalyptic events of God Eater: Resurrection, Rage Burst finds the remnants of humanity on a planet still overrun with godlike beasts known as Aragami. God Eater has always been about surviving the end of the world while looking good in the process. The introductory music-video cinematic sets expectations by showing off the agents’ fiery, demon-killing intensity while wielding God Arcs, transformable weapons often larger than a typical human. It’s easy to be motivated by your squad’s collective gung-ho attitude and the game’s bombastic choral soundtrack, which features the kind of compositions normally saved for final boss fights. The unabashed nature of its teen-targeted presentation is the crux of Rage Burst’s charm. The intricate, often vibrant youth-centric outfits serve as a reminder that Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts veteran Tetsuya Nomura does not have a monopoly on gratuitous zippers. The backdrops of desolate cities, fallen skyscrapers, and the imposing visages of otherworldly Aragami do little to dampen the hopes of the spry early twenty-somethings who make up your party. Anime-styled cutscenes are pleasant breaks in between sorties, and the steady stream of new characters help add diversity to your potential squad. Compared to Resurrection, Rage Burst’s initial cast is surprisingly easygoing, and it takes a few hours before more distinct archetypes join the cast. For example, the unsurprising addition of the overconfident-but-well-meaning agent serves as a poignant contrast to the introduction of the brooding-yet-skilled squadmate. Rage Burst isn’t as front-loaded with scene-setting exposition as Resurrection, which makes it easier to get started with the first batch of missions. Like in Monster Hunter and even Phantasy Star Online, it’s not unusual to revisit old maps or see foes from the past reprise their roles as prey in Rage Burst. They’re worth getting reaquainted with, especially given the imagination put into their designs. Large, bipedal bugs and helmeted lizards return, as does the gigantic gorilla sporting armor reminiscent of a Japanese demon. Combat is the main course in a god hunt that actually involves the consumption of the deities you’re tasked with vanquishing. The straightforwardness of Rage Burst’s “kill X” quests can appear shallow at first, and yes, you can accomplish many goals by making a beeline for your targets and mashing a basic combo. Exhilarating moments can be as simple as relentlessly pummeling your foe or showcasing an adept use of well-timed roll dodges. There’s a rush in avoiding an Aragami’s strike and fully capitalizing on the opportunity with a lethal thrashing. Aragamis aren’t pushovers, though. They can extend the fight with a hasty retreat to recover health. Different maps offer Aragami distinct escape routes--some inaccessible to your party--but it’s a problem easily fixed with a speedy chase along the paths you can use. If you’re smart when it comes to managing your ammo, you can interrupt a retreat with a well-placed salvo, even if the Aragami’s already 50 yards away. Rage Burst is rich in these satisfying tactical maneuvers. Moves partly executed in midair add flair to an already stylish squad. By adding complex staggers and cancels to your repertoire, you can appreciate the series’ fighting-game influence--and, more importantly, become a more meaningful contributor in battle. One of the game’s most rewarding combat features, Burst Mode, isn’t complex at all, though. If you can find a two-second window to charge your God Arc in melee mode, you can take a literal bite out of an Aragami, resulting in a temporary enhancement of your stats; it’s essentially God Eater’s “Super Saiyan” mode. It sounds twisted, but you can buff your friends by shooting at them. The most rewarding aspect of Burst Mode is the ability to use the same element-enhanced attacks of the Aragami that you consumed. It’s the equivalent of beating up an opponent with his own arm--which, by the way, you just ripped off. Loot is the key to molding and refining your character’s battle skills and combat prowess. Rage Burst’s modest difficulty makes it easy to craft weapons, where style can sometimes take precedent over optimization. Sorting through loot and pondering over stat upgrades can be overwhelming at times--the game offers more than 100 skill effects alone, and that doesn’t include support skills or status effects. It’s not unusual to spend more time poring over weapon-crafting than in completing a single assignment. What good is killing an Aragami if you don’t give yourself a fighting chance at an S-rank and looking great at the same time? It’s not a case of whether you live or die, but whether it takes 60 seconds or 5 minutes to finish the same sortie. It’s very much determined by how you’ve crafted your gear to your playstyle, but team chemistry is also a factor. While the AI can’t replicate the efficiency of a seasoned online team, the AI-controlled comrades are surprisingly reliable. Good sequels strike a balance between reproducing familiar systems and introducing new features. Rage Burst shares many similarities with Resurrection, to the degree that you wouldn’t be blamed for mistaking the former for an expansion pack of the latter at a glance. But Rage Burst is bolstered by a beefed-up combat system and scores of stylish, powerful loot, making frequent, sometimes repetitive questing, more enjoyable than it was in Resurrection.",,8.3
105,Nathan Ditum,Everyone,8,Pro Evolution Soccer 2017,"Sep 13, 2016"," Soccer is upon us. Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 has arrived, with FIFA trailing close behind. And, perhaps most visibly of all, the clattering circus of the soccer season itself--which both FIFA and PES must increasingly reflect and celebrate in order to stay relevant--has emerged from summer hibernation. And in terms of representing the global event, Konami’s PES 2017 is a genuine step forward for a series. Yes, there are signs here that PES’ rivalry with FIFA has led to an unnecessary overextension in features and modes, but the core of PES 2017--the soccer it plays--is competitive again. The improvements this year are a mixture of the specific and the general. Goalkeepers are a good example of the former--they’ve been heavily (and necessarily) reworked, offering not just a more realistic defense against corners and saveable shots, but also a dynamic set of animations that help give PES the kind of authenticity the series often lacked. Low one-handed dives, instinctive blocks with a single leg, and more authoritative claims under high-balls all help give this year’s keepers a reassuring sense of life and ability. There are also big improvements to ball control, turning, and the time it takes for players to recover after physical contact and changes of direction. These add up to a sharper, more agile game and collectively contribute to the feeling that PES 2017 has improved all over. Take first touches, the response time once you’ve pressed shoot or pass, and the sense of weight and momentum carried through turns when dribbling--in previous years, these joints and hinges of play were where PES creaked the loudest. This year, their improvement makes building up an attack or just knocking the ball around a pleasure again, even (crucially) away from the top-tier teams. More specifically, this year the skill dribbling ability comes into its own. PES has a pretty deep set of skills buried in its control system, but it’s intricate to the point that learning more than a one or two showpieces is beyond most players. In PES 2017, the tight-control dribbling offers a rough equivalent to FIFA’s right-stick skill system--an accessible way to wrong-foot defenders, open up space, and create unexpected angles. Like FIFA’s system, the exact moves your player will pull off depend on their skill level, so it’s less impactful with John Stones or even Eric Dier than Raheem Sterling or Erik Lamela. Still, it’s a useful touch to slow down play and wait for options, no matter which players are on the pitch. One more particularly prominent element of PES’ improvements this year is the fluidity of attacking play. Through balls and crosses have a high success rate and always feel dangerous. True, through balls aren’t so handy for build-up play--short ones played as part of midfield triangles are often frustratingly underpowered, which can often pull you into messy scraps--but in the final third, they feel reliably deadly. Crosses, too, just feel more user-friendly. Dramatic, aesthetically pleasing arcs can be produced on the run, from deep outside the box, or under pressure from opposing players, making flowing, edge-of-the-seat football not just possible but common, and on all levels of the game. If playing with the ball has taken a big stride forward, defending this year is more of a qualified success. One-on-one defending out-wide is fine. It’s a mixture of positional play and timing, and slide tackling feels pleasingly potent. But in congested mid-fields and as the ball moves toward the box, defending can become clumsy and haphazard. AI-controlled teammates sometimes double up on the opposing player with the ball, ignore simple interceptions during scrambles for possession, or simply get in each other’s way. Often, a well-timed slide-tackle results in player control being switched to a nearby teammate while the tackler gets up from the pitch, even though he’s still the favorite to reach the ball first. If the joy and intensity of attacking in this year’s game is excellent, the defending struggles to keep up. But away from its core gameplay, PES 2017 struggles. There was a time, on PS2 and beyond, when Pro Evo played such a good game of soccer that its lack of licensed teams and kits wasn’t an issue (this year PES has assembled a patchwork of licenses from individual teams - Barcelona, Liverpool and Dortmund being the only European sides officially featured). In recent years, FIFA has not only had a monopoly on authenticity but also offered the best gameplay, too. Even with PES’ recent strides, there’s no daylight between the two games, and the value of real names, grounds, and the rest is higher than ever. This is a thing peculiar to our age--a time of intense media management, brand partnerships, saturated coverage, and constant streams of social media interaction. Soccer is everywhere, all the time, and a sniff of the inauthentic means death in this slick transaction between sport and customer. PES, in other words, is Gobots. FIFA is Transformers. Yes, it’s possible to download and tinker with option files to improve the in-game presentation. And, yes, Master League--still the game’s best mode, classic offline dream-team assembly--is like a refuge from the branded assault of modern soccer, an escape into an unlicensed parallel world. But PES 2017’s focus isn’t on Master League. It’s on myClub, the squad builder that is, in base terms, like Master League with microtransactions. FIFA's Ultimate Team has become an enormously popular and lucrative juggernaut. It powers season-long attachment to the game, forms the basis of constant YouTube coverage, and ties the real-life sport into FIFA’s virtual soccer. Konami clearly feels that PES has to be active in this space, whether for the microtransaction income, or because it’s seen as an entry-level feature, but PES’ licensing shortfalls make myClub a difficult sell. Even with improvements on last year’s presentation--including a concise introductory tutorial and clearly laid-out panel menus--there’s a hollowness to the mode that leaves it feeling like a off-brand alternative. Not helping in this regard is PES’ continued inconsistency online. The ultimate goal of myClub is to take your gleaming team of stars and pit them against online opposition, either in one-off games or the mini-league Divisions mode (also borrowed more or less directly from FIFA). But online play suffers from serious connectivity issues. Wait times for opponents are lengthy, and most games I played suffered from a latency that left a full half-second between me pressing a button and my player releasing a pass or a shot--essentially unplayable in a game built on anticipation and timing. I had a good connection roughly the same number of times I was disconnected entirely; heavy lag was the standard. All of which leaves PES 2017 feeling like a superbly talented team of footballers playing on a terrible, uneven pitch. If your football game of choice complements your love of the real-life sport, or you’re interested in testing yourself against online all-comers, consider yourself warned. If you’re unlikely to play online and don’t mind tinkering for an hour or so to get your leagues looking unofficially official, PES is once more a serious contender.

106,Mat Paget,Everyone,9,NBA 2K17,"Sep 16, 2016"," NBA 2K17 feels like it was made by a team of people who live and breathe basketball. Everything from the meticulous presentation to MyCareer mode's practice drills exhibits the care and attention that only come from people who get whisked away in midday dreams of playing in the NBA--and that makes it doubly easy for you to do the same. This is the first time I've delved past an NBA 2K game's Play Now and Blacktop modes, and in witnessing how great this game is, I’m beginning to wonder why I never did so in the first place. 2K's NBA games are known for smooth, fluid play, and true to form, 2K17 allows you to move the ball around the court, mixing in advanced ball maneuvers and fancy footwork with ease. Employing the right stick's ability to juke is when you'll really feel the satisfaction of faking out an opponent on your way to the net. It's empowering to know that you outsmarted the opposition, and it's a credit to the game's controls that complex moves are accessible and feel natural. Once you grow accustomed to the potential at your fingertips--a fast process--NBA 2K17 feels like a game of instincts, rather than a calculated series of inputs. Of course, victory wouldn't feel as sweet if the AI didn't put up a good fight, and given its prowess, you need to employ smart positioning and playmaking to get to the hoop. Experimenting with the tools at hand is as essential as it is satisfying when you put a winning strategy into action--and humbling when you're stuffed by a clever opponent. The AI isn't going to fall for the same trick every time, so mixing up your strategies is required--passing the ball to your best player in an attempt to score three points every time isn't going work. Finding out the best way to tackle each shift on the court is continually rewarding and engages you wholeheartedly in the excellent on-court action. To get your bearings, you can jump into the 2KU mode, which has you participate in scrimmage games, and feeds you tutorial tips as you play. Gameplay pauses as instructions and narration pop up to let you know how to pass, shoot, and retrieve the ball on defense. This can be helpful for learning the basics, but it would be a lot more effective if the game reacted to your performance and coached you appropriately rather than merely providing static direction. For example, it doesn't let you know why you lost a jump ball or why you got a foul for trying to knock a ball loose. Without a responsive, real-time feedback system, NBA 2K17's training mode feels more like a primer than a full-fledged tutorial. When it's game time, NBA 2K17's commentators, camera angles, and mid-game events--such as mascot antics and halftime dunk shows--demonstrate incredible realism and attention to detail. Fans get excited at the right moments, with intercepted passes and turnovers riling them up the most. The only downside to the whole broadcast setup is the pre-game and half-time shows; they sound good, but the virtual hosts are stiff. It often looks like someone’s pulling the strings of realistic Ernie Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Kenny Smith puppets. Thankfully, they're a relatively small part of the package, and the rest of the presentation, particularly the commentary and fans, makes every game feel like you're playing in the NBA. Playing with authentic teams and players scratches the NBA itch, but MyCareer offers a different kind of game, where you create a player and master a single position as you make your way through college and into the pros. Cutscenes are infrequent, but they add some nice background to you and your life through moments of playing video games with a friend or talking to your excited, caring mom over the phone. They're not super impactful, but the way everyone in your life reacts to you and your playing makes you want to do better on the court. Playing as a single athlete can feel restrictive in some sports games, but playing your part on a team in 2K17 is thoroughly rewarding. Setting up a teammate for an alley-oop or having someone pass to you so you can make that key three-point shot fosters an awesome sensation that feels like real teamwork, where you have total ownership over your role. Sure, you can call for the ball every second and hog it like Kobe, but you'd be robbing yourself of the satisfaction that comes with skillful cooperation. Playing as a single athlete can feel restrictive in some sports games, but playing your part on a team in 2K17's MyCareer mode is thoroughly rewarding. You can actually improve your game by participating in practices--various types of mini games. They might challenge you to sink as many alternating three-point shots as possible, shoot the ball from a specific spot, or play a game of one-on-one. Most of these challenges are fun, making the choice to go to the gym before a game a lot easier. Outside of playing basketball, MyCareer encourages you to take part in life off the court. You can attend promotional and fan events to get a little extra currency to spend on attributes and upgrades. These amount to nothing more than selecting a menu item, watching your player walk out the door, and then getting a message saying you completed the event. The lack of interactivity with these events is fine, but the amount of time it takes for this process to finish feels a bit excessive. Additionally, you get text messages from friends, players, and coaches, and the way you respond will change the way certain people react to you. These moments of texting are often funny and add a bit of life in between games and practices that's much appreciated. 2K17 offers a number of modes to play online against other players, and for the most part, the connection holds up well. In my several hours of online testing, I came across a few games where the connection was fairly bad, resulting in a match that was nearly unplayable. Thankfully, these encounters were few and far between. You can compete against other players in the basic Play Now mode or take a team you assemble through card packs and face off against others in MyTeam. In this mode, you kick things off with a starter pack that gives you a small bounty of cards to help you build a lineup of players. In addition to paying real money for these packs, you can earn them by racking up in-game currency. This process takes much longer, and you aren't guaranteed to get any useful cards in a pack. This can be frustrating, especially when you pay real money toward the purchase of card packs. You're better off buying the players you want from the auction house. Doing what essentially amounts to gambling is a risk that just isn't worth it. Despite its few drawbacks, NBA 2K17's excitement for basketball is contagious, and it's hard not to get wrapped up in it. Apart from the lacking 2KU mode and stiff recreations of commentators, the rest of the game looks great and plays even better. After finally devoting a significant amount of time to one of these games, I now see why it's such a well-regarded series, and it makes me wish that every sport got the same treatment that basketball does in NBA 2K17.

107,Mike Mahardy,Teen,6,Destiny,"Sep 9, 2014"," With Rise of Iron, Destiny feels like a game that’s within reach of fresh ideas, but can’t quite escape its own past. There are moments of exhilaration throughout the newest expansion, and a few inspiring missions remain rooted in my memory, but as Bungie’s shooter wades into its third year, a sense of fatigue has risen to the surface. Destiny’s exhaustion is beginning to show. From a story standpoint, Rise of Iron follows our Guardians as they assist Lord Saladin, one of the last remaining members of the Iron Lords, in his fight against Siva, a nanobot plague that all but exterminated his group years before present events. Rise of Iron borrows its aesthetic from fantasy tales such as Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, pulling us up to the snowy Felwinter Peak to the sound of low horns and loud clarion calls. At its outset, Rise of Iron displays a confident sense of character. But that wears thin soon thereafter. Destiny’s new campaign lasts for about 90 minutes, and while it does a decent job of setting up the expansion’s late-game missions and public events, the plot serves only to introduce us to new quest-givers and areas of interest. Any narrative promise the opening moments display soon fades. The campaign’s final boss battle may be thrilling--it encourages frantic melee combat against an onslaught of enemies--but the short trip it takes to get there is forgettable. As a major Destiny expansion, of course, Rise of Iron also brings additional cooperative strikes, public events, player vs. player options, a new social space, a new patrol zone, and a six-player raid. I call this content additional, and not new, for a reason: much of Rise of Iron’s content is taken from Destiny’s first two years and given a fresh coat of paint. Yes, Siva-infected enemies bring new dangers to firefights, and existing bosses have changed their combat strategy to make things just fresh enough to initially feel different. But the Destiny grind is more apparent here than ever. I’m once again firing round after round into Sepiks Prime. I’m patrolling the snowy wilderness on a strikingly familiar Earth. I’m wading through strikes I’ve played dozens of times before. The Wretched Eye strike, Rise of Iron’s truly new cooperative venture, is one of the aforementioned shining moments. But it’s surrounded by vapid echoes of the past. Rise of Iron’s player vs. player content follows suit. The new Supremacy game mode requires you to pick up fallen orbs from slain enemies, not granting you full credit for a kill until you do so. You can also deny opponents their points by collecting your comrades’ telltale remains--the system creates tense situations as players rush into the open to gather orbs, only to die and make the field that much more tantalizing for the next challenger. Smart players can hang back and pick off scavengers shortly before gathering several points for themselves. While Supremacy does lure you out of your comfort zone with enticing scenarios, the experience is only a slight variation on the classic deathmatch formula. As with Rise of Iron’s campaign, Supremacy feels uninspired. Rise of Iron’s maps are well designed, combining close-quarters battles and long-range engagements with seeming ease, proving once again that studio Bungie is a top-tier developer of competitive shooter arenas. But these maps set the stage for a new mode that doesn’t pull its own creative weight. The redundancies in Destiny's campaign, strikes, and Crucible content are a shame, too, considering the moments of greatness Rise of Iron does deliver. The redundancies in Destiny’s campaign, strikes, and Crucible content are a shame, too, considering the moments of greatness Rise of Iron does deliver. The quest line to obtain the newest version of Gjallahorn, Destiny’s now-mythical rocket launcher, culminates in a massive battle the likes of which Bungie hasn’t created since its Halo days. Archon’s Forge, the expansion’s new public event space, plays host to chaotic battles between a possible nine players and a variety of alien bosses. The sheer spectacle of these skirmishes combines with Destiny’s mechanical fluidity to create some of the shooter’s finest moments to date. This rings true in Rise of Iron’s Wrath of the Machine raid. The trek pits you and five other players against an array of enemies in a bevy of complex scenarios that don’t use boss battles and hordes of enemies as crutches. While these elements are present, Wrath of the Machine demands that you rethink what a boss fight can be: without spoiling too much, one section of the raid asks you not just to battle a massive enemy, but use it as transportation, too. Wrath of the Machine’s final encounter is one of those shining moments I keep coming back to. Despite the difficulty you’ll encounter, it’s a stunning combination of teamwork, survival techniques, and combat tactics, as well as using the expansion’s pervasive Siva against itself, that will carry your squad through. But the raid is the sparkling light at the end of an often-dreary tunnel. I spent dozens of hours slogging through familiar strikes, uninspired new Crucible content, and a patrol zone that felt like a retread, not an adventure. I found myself playing more for the new gear and Light levels--for the progress--than the actual enjoyment. As an expansion that revamped how Destiny actually played, last year’s The Taken King was a major step forward for the shooter. But Rise of Iron feels merely like the other foot catching up to rest firmly in place. It feels timid. It feels safe. It feels like the last remaining breath before the possible sequel, as if Destiny is standing still and waiting for inspiration to arrive, rather than going out to find it.          ",Destiny is the newest franchise from Bungie and its ambitious successor to Halo. It is a first-person shooter with elements of open-world sandbox and persistent world where humans are up against an alien threat seeking to rid them of existence.,6.8
108,Nathan Ditum,Everyone,9,FIFA 17,"Sep 27, 2016"," Being consistently good can bring its own problems. Among the highlight gameplay changes in this year's FIFA we have: better throw-ins, low driven shots, and the ability to control the ball from a long keeper kick. Welcome improvements, sure, but still, pity the guy making them sound exciting in the press release. Maybe that's why FIFA 17, a football game that checks all the usual boxes you’d expect of an already successful annual sports title--trimming, tidying, domination by iteration--also throws in a more glamorous and unexpected addition: The Journey. The Journey is a new story-based mode centering on Alex Hunter, a young player breaking into professional football. It’s built from a mix of gameplay, dialogue, and cutscenes, which depict Alex’s evolving relationships with his family and teammates and, ultimately, whether his talent is enough to kickstart a dream career. It is, in other words, a football Cinderella story--and, as such, it marks a pleasant change from the relentless capitalism of FIFA’s monstrously successful Ultimate Team. FIFA already contains at least three modes life-consuming enough to take up 12 months of your spare time, and aside from an annual release schedule that demands a constant supply of newness, recapturing some of the hope and romance of football seems the only logical reason for The Journey to exist. As for the mode itself, hope and romance are what it does best--convincing dramatics and RPG gameplay, not so much. Choice within The Journey is, in practice, pretty limited, outside of the initial opportunity to choose which Premier League side Hunter joins. Certain fixed plot points underpin the story. They happen no matter how you’re performing on the pitch or behaving off it--things like being sent out on loan, or Hunter’s childhood friend and teammate Gareth Walker being inexplicably awful to him the whole time. Once you start leveling up, you can directly apply upgrade points to specific skills, enabling you to make Hunter exactly the sort of player you'd like him to be. But there's less flexibility in the dialogue choices offered during certain cutscenes and post-match interviews. These are clearly labeled--""fiery,"" ""cool,"" ""balanced""--and rather than leading individually to different opportunities or outcomes, these decisions are aggregated into a binary temperament gauge showing whether Hunter is hot-headed or sensible. This, in turn, has an effect on cosmetic things like how pleased your manager is with you or how many fans you have, but it doesn’t unlock any significant changes in events. While lead actor Adetomiwa Edun (Merlin, Bates Motel) shines through the performance capture process to offer a vulnerable, determined Alex Hunter, The Journey still sounds the occasional awkward dramatic note. Interactions between characters can seem forced, like Alex’s dad storming away from an early game or your rivalry with Gareth. And sometimes the locations themselves (especially exteriors) are quiet and empty, giving the scenes an unreal, disconnected feel. Speaking of unrealistic, sometimes the cost of mistakes seems unfeasibly high. At one point, Hunter was established in the first team at Tottenham Hotspur, and a red card led directly to him getting released from his contract despite the fact that he'd scored in the previous three games (requiring a return to the latest save). A talking-to or even a transfer listing might’ve worked here; to suggest a player scoring goals in the Premier League could find his contract canceled and career over because of a sending-off is bizarre. And yet, for all that, The Journey captures something that the existing parts of FIFA never have. Despite its rough edges, there are moments here that deliver a kind of brute emotional force: the opening scene of Sunday morning boys’ football, which puts the cliched tale in a delicate context; a pitch-side camera’s view of Hunter’s first goal for the senior side, with his own delirious shout audible above the crowd; various quiet moments of triumph and failure with family. It lacks sophistication, but The Journey has something, and it succeeds in attaching an added emotional weight to your actions on the pitch. It lacks sophistication, but The Journey has something, and it succeeds in attaching an added emotional weight to your actions on the pitch. As for the rest of this year's update, FIFA 17 feels like a round of unglamorous but welcome housekeeping after the relatively thorough gameplay changes of last year. EA has touted the switch to the Frostbite engine, a change that will presumably pay off increasingly in future years. Right now, wide shots of stadiums look very pretty, especially at night and with mist hanging in the air. But elsewhere, you'd be hard pressed to spot the difference, and some locations in The Journey--offices, bedrooms, changing rooms--look a little flat and characterless. The gameplay improvements this year are typified by much-needed tweaks but also feel like the kind of changes you only get around to when there's nothing really pressing to address. So now throw-ins can be dummied much like a faked shot, giving players a way to move defenders around and get a better chance of keeping possession. Free kicks and penalties have been freed up, so you can choose your angle of approach and charge your cross or shot much more like you would in regular play. Physical play, too, has been refined so that holding the left trigger down is now the way to let the game know, in attack or defense, that you want your players to engage physically with the other team. It's a small tweak, but it’s one that removes some of the mystery surrounding jostling while defending and seems very useful for holding on to the ball while in possession, especially with sturdy midfielders like Mousa Dembele or Paul Pogba. Finally, the inclusion of low, driven shots adds an appreciable new wrinkle to offensive play. Nail the timing, and you're able to power efforts on goal low and accurately, finally ending the years-long, reality-defying rule that more power must equal more height. Other welcome-but-non-revolutionary additions include multiplayer skill games--things like passing drills and small matches of two-on-two--which are so much fun that the loading screens for full matches now threaten to become the matches themselves. There’s also the fact that reality--or a small slice of it, at least--has been invited into Career mode. Your objectives in managing a club are now more specifically tailored to the club in question, and are divided into Domestic and Continental success, Brand Value, Finance, and Youth Development. Pick Tottenham, for example, and your club overlords will be less worried about European success than winning at home. Choose Manchester United, and you'll not only have high expectations in terms of winning trophies but also a global brand to sustain. It's a relatively simple way of removing the mode's previous one-size-fits-all feel while giving a sense of individuality to every playthrough. There's now a reason other than boredom to switch clubs or start a new career altogether. This year's FIFA, then, can be fairly summarized as one big change that doesn't quite pay off, and lots of small ones that do. Ultimate Team remains FIFA’s biggest draw, with EA choosing to add to rather than tinker with a winning formula. The most notable addition are Squad Building Challenges, which require players to construct sides with certain conditions--using only players of two different nationalities, or with a minimum chemistry level--and then submit them for rewards. It’s a very smart piece of design, not only giving players a use for the scores of bronze and silver players they’ll accrue over the course of a season (and that will never feature in a playing squad), but also making play of the subtle and sophisticated problem-solving that already underpins Ultimate Team’s systems. This year's FIFA, then, can be fairly summarized as one big change that doesn't quite pay off, and lots of small ones that do. The Journey is engaging enough that it'll be interesting to see how it's developed next year, but right now, it's not the reason to buy FIFA 17. That remains a combination of still-excellent fundamental gameplay (on a par, at least, with Pro Evolution Soccer 2017's much-improved showing) and Ultimate Team, the game-above-the-game to which PES still has no serious answer. Put together with an improved Career mode and best-in-class presentation, and FIFA 17 is still out in front--even if its lead has been cut this year.",FIFA 17 is soccer game powered by Frostbite.,7.9
109,Don Saas,Teen,9,World of Warcraft,"Nov 23, 2004"," More than a decade into World of Warcraft's shelf life, it's fair to say that Blizzard has spent years spinning its wheels narratively, even as it continued to polish the MMO formula the company helped to enshrine. Mists of Pandaria introduced new races tangential to the Horde/Alliance conflict, and Warlords of Draenor was essentially an alternate-history nostalgia trip of the game's real-time strategy roots. But with Legion, Blizzard continues its streak of integrating the best of contemporary MMO mechanical design but also radically alters the balance of power in their world for the first time since 2010's Cataclysm. It's a gamble that pays off. Legion finds Azeroth's greatest existential threat making its first return since Burning Crusade. Thanks to the treacherous orc warlock Gul'dan (who lives again thanks to the events of Warlords of Draenor), the titular demonic Legion has been set loose on Azeroth once more. Although the Alliance and the Horde combine forces at the expansion's beginning to turn back the tide of this invasion, their attempts are crushed. You are then tasked with finding the Pillars of Creation--ancient devices created by the Titans, who predate mortal life on Azeroth--which are the only hope of closing the portals to the Twisting Nether. Unless you're invested in almost two decades' worth of Warcraft lore, that all may sound confusing. Although purchasing Legion gives players a free character boost to level 100--the new starting level for the expansion--it's clear that Legion exists for WoW's core player base. It's fortunate, then, that the twists and major emotional beats of Legion will mean something to those players who have been with the game since its early days. Legion starts off with a string of impactful tragedies and doesn't pull any punches from there. Characters you've known since WoW's inception aren't safe. The demonic corruption of the Legion takes major lore heroes from the series' RTS days and turns them into tragic villains. Dragonflights--which have been on the decline since Cataclysm--reach death's door. When hostilities between the Alliance and the Horde heat up again, it happens for extremely personal reasons--and, for once, it doesn't seem like one faction makes an inexplicably idiotic decision that brings new life to their war. By the end of the expansion's basic PvE content, you're given a firsthand look at the mana addiction that ruptured elven society (and invited the Legion to Azeroth in the first place). It's hard to complain about that brevity when the content that gets you there is some of the best-designed world questing that Blizzard has produced to date. Quests are focused and meaningful from the moment you choose your starting zone--Legion comprises four. You can hit the new level cap of 110 after about a week or so of moderate play, but it's hard to complain about that brevity when the content that gets you there is some of the best-designed world questing that Blizzard has produced to date. Legion also includes some of WoW's best non-heroic/non-raid dungeon design in years. Although the game doesn't meet the genre heights set by something like Final Fantasy XIV, even the first dungeons of the expansion require actual coordination and teamwork. The average boss is your simple ""tank 'n' spank,"" but Legion also offers a host of bosses with more complex movesets to manage. There are also a handful of new engagement types, such as guiding the boss between two different energy beams to mitigate attacks or finding runes on the arena floor that heal your character and give them added strength. These dungeons are tied to story progression---as well as some of the best early gear in the game--and weed out the less-competent players. Whether stemming the corruption of the Emerald Dream in Val'sharah, uniting tauren tribes in Highmountain, or battling the resurgent naga in Azsuna, the new zones are built around straightforward goals. You rarely have to question why you have to kill this or collect that, and the sense of busywork that WoW's basic quest design can often engender is thankfully absent. You get to play a part in shaping not just the fight against the Legion, but new societies you discover as well. WoW has a rich lore that isn't always integrated well (or at all) into its direct play, but Legion doesn't have that problem. Legion's new Class Hall system also finds ways to integrate WoW's lore into the game in meaningful ways. Each class (and subclass) has its own artifact weapon, acquired at the beginning of the expansion, that levels as you play. These aren't just random weapons that you get from dungeon bosses--odds are that veteran players are familiar with them from past Warcraft experiences. Players may be forced to head back to Icecrown Citadel to acquire their class weapon, and Demon Hunters get trips to Karazhan and other places of classic WoW import. Legion's new zones are positively gorgeous, working in broad-but-memorable aesthetic strokes. WoW is running on a modified engine that's 12 years old at this point, and while you can tell you're playing a game with graphics not too far removed from the PS2 era, Legion's new zones are positively gorgeous, working in broad-but-memorable aesthetic strokes. The Nordic cliffsides and towering sculptures of Stormheim bring a richness to the zone's hyperbolic Viking fantasy. Val'sharah, a sprawling, overrun forest teeming with life and corruption, is the heart of Azeroth's original World Tree. And Legion's final leveling zone, Suramar, is awash with psychedelic purples and oranges and reds that speak to its place as the heart of the plague currently consuming Azeroth. Legion's new class, the Demon Hunter, doesn't change things too much in terms of the game's traditional Holy Trinity of tank/healer/DPS. It's a melee DPS/tank hybrid, but it adds a wrinkle that almost spoils the allure of the game's other classes. Demon Hunters can double-jump and glide across landscapes, and it gives them such a degree of mobility and agility that all of the other classes feel sluggish and restrained in comparison. Few things in Legion prove to be more satisfying than avoiding a lengthy walk by just leaping off a cliff and diving to a new destination, further solidifying the Demon Hunters' status as WoW's new essential class. The biggest complaint one can make about Legion is that it does so many things so well that it serves to remind you that World of Warcraft is now a mosaic of more than a decade's worth of different design principles. Cataclysm revamped the entire vanilla WoW experience, but players who want to roll alts or start WoW for the first time (and experience it in its entirety) have to play through Burning Crusade and Lich King content, which just aren't half as smartly designed as WoW in its current incarnation. Blizzard keeps getting better at what it does; six expansions in, it shouldn't feel like a chore to get to the game's best content--but it does. With Legion, it's hard to remember when WoW's narrative and questing were ever this strong before. Time will tell if Blizzard will serve up a healthy dose of new content to keep the expansion and game alive (a la Mists or Lich King) or if it will suffer the fate of Warlords of Draenor, but right now (about a month after the expansion's release) Blizzard has proven it can still craft an MMO experience as well as--if not better--than anyone else.  ","World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role playing game that takes places four years since the aftermath of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos where thousands of players can interact within the same world, from adventuring together to fighting against each other in epic battles.",8.8
110,Heidi Kemps,Everyone 10+,7,River City: Tokyo Rumble,"Sep 27, 2016"," Kunio’s a hot-blooded teenager who’s known as the toughest punk at school--his very name sends fear down the spines of rival troublemakers across Tokyo. Grades and respect for authority mean little to him--he’s all about fighting for his own personal brand of justice, and if that means pummeling a few muscle-heads on the back streets of Tokyo, he’ll do it. However, what seems like a personal scuffle between one of Kunio’s friends and a rival group turns out to be a plot by a vicious gang to conquer all of Tokyo. It’s up to Kunio and company to clean up the streets in order to put a stop to their plans. River City: Tokyo Rumble utilizes much of the familiar gameplay and visual style of River City Ransom--a cult-classic NES brawler. As Kunio, you bash your way across side-scrolling sections of Tokyo, fighting off mobs of rivals and local punks and picking up the loot and cash they drop, all while learning more about the strangely lovable band of delinquent scrappers you’re controlling. Tokyo Rumble’s combat is pretty basic when compared to other beat-em-ups, but that’s not really a huge mark against it--the easy-to-learn controls make it a breeze for players of all skill levels to start delivering some beatdowns. Of course, if things didn’t increase in complexity, the game would get dull pretty fast--but that’s a point where Tokyo Rumble excels much in the same way as the original RCR. As you pick up money and items dropped by defeated enemies, you can buy food, equipment, and skills to help augment your character. Gear like boots and brass knuckles raise your fighting stats, while buying instructions on new fighting skills from bookstores adds new moves to your arsenal--they increase your options during combat without significantly upping the control complexity. Pummeling enemies also increases your level, allowing you to get stronger and stronger as the game goes on. Tokyo Rumble is modeled after RCR in its gameplay and visuals, but this time publisher Natsume has opted for a somewhat different style of localization that preserves much of the Japanese setting--many areas are based on real-life parts of Tokyo--and cultural tough-guy tropes that were missing from RCR. The result is a game that feels both comfortingly familiar and fascinatingly different to fans of the original RCR. Supplementing this is an all-new quest system that has Kunio and company doing various errands in areas they’ve already cleared, such as fighting special bosses or looking for hidden mystery shops. Progressing through the game will also let you recruit CPU-controlled helper characters, who tag along with you but fight and level up independently. You can give your CPU pals basic orders, such as “help” or “stay back,” and they can be great assets during tougher boss brawls. I say “tougher” because Tokyo Rumble isn’t a terribly difficult game on the default setting: I played through on Normal, and it felt quite breezy as long as I kept a few healing items on hand for the bosses. It’s also not a terribly lengthy game, either: you’ll likely be able to smack your way through this on a lazy Saturday. While you can extend the game length by taking on the various optional missions available throughout the game, many of these missions actually make the game less fun, like asking you to beat a high number of faceless thugs in certain parts of the city or entering the same areas over and over again in hopes of finding a rare enemy encounter. Tokyo Rumble does a good job of avoiding repetition in the core game, but asking you to waste time bashing generic thugs can make the combat really start to wear out its welcome. The same goes with boss fights: While some bosses have a few neat tricks up their sleeves, such as surrounding themselves with speedy motorcycle gangsters that need to be KO’ed with jump attacks, a lot of them are simply brutes that favor perseverance over skill. While the main game is brief, it’s plenty of fun, and bonus minigames like dodgeball add some extra charm to Tokyo Rumble. It’s a solid action game with a charming retro flavor that leverages RCR's foundation to construct both a new adventure and a different perspective on beloved game. Here’s to hoping that Tokyo Rumble heralds the further adventures of Kunio and company coming Westward as well.  ","River City: Tokyo Rumble follows the story of a hot-blooded high school student named Kunio and his good friends. When a nefarious gang moves into Tokyo to try to take it over, it's up to this self-proclaimed ""fighter for justice"" and his buddies to make sure the streets stay safe!",6
111,Matt Espineli,Teen,8,Azure Striker Gunvolt 2,"Sep 29, 2016"," Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 is a fulfilling follow-up to Inti Creates' electric 3DS action-platformer from 2014, and while it's notably similar in many ways, the subtle changes it introduces expand and enrich the experience. An additional playable character--the returning antihero Copen--completely changes the way the game is played, and expanded sub-systems imbue the action with newfound significance and complexity. Whether you've played the first game or not, Gunvolt 2 is an exemplary display of tightly-paced action from start to finish. Gunvolt 2's story takes place shortly after the events of the first game, throwing its electric-powered protagonist, the titular Gunvolt, into a conflict against Eden, a fanatical group of superpowered individuals known as Adepts. However, Gunvolt isn't the only one standing against Eden; his rival and anti-adept extremist, Copen, has also entered the fray fueled by his own agenda. Despite the fact that the game offers a different campaign for each of its two playable characters, the narratives told aren't very memorable--each follow a structure that more or less resembles an extended fetch quest. At times, a hint of self-aware writing attempts to tide over the lacking story, but these moments end up more cringeworthy than entertaining. Fortunately, these narrative issues do little to undermine the game’s strongest quality: run-and-gun action. Like its predecessor, combat is focused on tagging enemies with pistol fire and zapping them with a devastating surge of electricity. The game's distinct ""tag-and-assault"" playstyle deconstructs the rudimentary nature of combat within run-and-gun action games, breaking down the formula into a multi-step process. The result is combat that's both incredibly engaging and satisfying in practice. For those who played the first game, it's worth noting that Gunvolt's abilities haven't changed much, as the skills and abilities he earns throughout the game are identical, like his HP restoring Galvanic Patch skill and his powerful Luxcalibur projectile attack. Some minor additions are present, however, such as new items that allow you to increase the number of enemies you can tag. These don't do much to enhance the already well-realized Gunvolt, but despite the lack of any meaningful changes, he remains an entertaining protagonist. Then there's Copen, a character whose addition opens up a wealth of new combat opportunities. Like Gunvolt, Copen's primary method of attack is tied to tagging and assaulting his enemies. But while Gunvolt tags an enemy by shooting them, Copen does so by dashing into them. Once an enemy's tagged, Copen can follow up with a barrage of powerful homing bullets from his pistol. This might sound like a miniscule deviation from the formula, but the differences between Copen and Gunvolt are immense. For starters, Copen can only tag one enemy at a time, while Gunvolt can tag up to three. To compensate for this limitation, Copen has a higher degree of mobility, thanks to his ability to air dash in six different directions. In addition, he sports an arsenal of support weapons that help compensate for his inability to tag more than one enemy. For instance, he has a dual water cannon that can provide supporting fire, and a drill weapon he can deploy to cover his rear. Copen is by far the more gratifying character to play as, offering a complex set of tactics to learn, an array of attack options to use, and a sense of speed that's continually exhilarating. Thankfully, the stages are meticulously designed around each character's playstyle, providing a diverse selection of obstacles to navigate, hazards to avoid, and enemies to defeat. During the first half of the game, each character traverses stages completely unique to his campaign. The latter half, however, has both characters progressing through the same ones. This structure lends itself well to emphasizing the unique abilities that Gunvolt and Copen posses. While none of the areas are particularly memorable on a visual level, the challenges they present keep the pacing tight--the game never lets up as you unleash an onslaught of destruction against the waves of enemies in your way. The experience is further enhanced by the kudos system, an adjustable score counter that increases as you defeat enemies. The catch? If you're hit often, you stand to lose all the points you've earned. The points you do earn are saved at the semi-frequent checkpoints you encounter and contribute to your total score at the end of a stage. This feeds into the crafting system--the better your total score value, the more crafting items you can obtain at the end of the stage. From there, you can create special equipment to improve your character's abilities. This all may sound superficial on paper, but in practice, the system injects the action with a new level of challenge, unlocking a difficulty you wouldn't have otherwise known existed by simply playing the game. Hazards and bosses take on a whole new meaning when you can only take one hit before your score multiplier goes straight to zero. With three different kudos-system options to choose from--each offering different handicaps and score multipliers--there's more than enough challenge to take on. When these various mechanics all function at once, things can get crowded on-screen. This is further compounded by dialogue boxes that take up nearly a third of the screen, sometimes obscuring the position of enemies. Fortunately, the dialogue can be turned off, but that feels counterintuitive if you're trying to understand the narrative. The presence of an English dub might have alleviated these issues--Gunvolt 2 is dubbed in Japanese--but even then, the amount of space taken up by the speech boxes on the screen remains a major issue when trying to focus on the action ahead. With a host of bonus stages and challenge modes that unlock after clearing each campaign, Gunvolt 2 provides enough to inspire you to go back in for another run--either to refine your skills or simply to bask in the bliss of combat and movement. While an uninspired story and intrusive dialogue displays hold the game back from reaching its potential, what's here remains incredibly satisfying and worthwhile.",,8
112,Cassidee Moser,Everyone,6,Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice,"Sep 27, 2016"," Although formulaic and somewhat one-note, Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice is a fast-paced platformer in a similar vein to classic side-scrolling Sonic the Hedgehog games. It combines the same enjoyable spin-dashing, looping courses, and ring collecting of old with some new--albeit vapid--ideas. The story comes down to the classic struggle of Sonic and friends trying to clean up the mess left in the wake of Dr. Robotnik’s shenanigans. The only difference, however, is the fact that mysterious rifts in the world have integrated with the tech worn by Sonic and his buddies, temporarily granting them their newfound fire and ice powers. With a button tap, you can charge Sonic with fire or ice powers, allowing him to burn away or melt obstacles and freeze solid water for easier traversal across hazardous environments. These features are useful in more challenging sections with many obstacles that call for quick reflexes, including moments where moving pillars have to be avoided by quickly switching between fire and ice to enter safe zones beneath the hazards, but the feature is not so great when it brings fast-paced sequences to a jarring, unnecessary halt by sending characters crashing headfirst into an icy brick wall or through water into a pit of spikes. You have the ability throughout the game to rapidly switch between different characters from the Sonicverse, including Knuckles, Tails, and Amy. Each character has their own unique special ability that can occasionally be used to access otherwise gated sections or each stage. For example, Amy’s hammer can bash walls or floors to move certain obstacles and Knuckles’ burrowing ability allows him to dig underground. Some abilities can occasionally be used for mundane tasks like collecting items, but they rarely have any meaningful application aside from accessing hard-to-reach areas. And really, searching for hidden items is largely inconsequential, more of a temptation for completionists than a beneficial pursuit in practical terms. Like the fire-and-ice mechanic, special abilities and collectibles are ultimately underutilized. The flow of Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice is also unabashedly formulaic. Every island Sonic visits has a handful of standard 2D levels set in seemingly arbitrary environments, like a prehistoric beach or a pirate bay. Accompanying these core areas are a few others with different formats that break up the flow of typical side-scrolling levels. These include a runner-like minigame in which Sonic auto-runs while dodging obstacles using his fire and ice powers; a side-scrolling, time-limited submarine-diving minigame used to acquire trading-card collectibles; and one-on-one races with one of Robotnik’s super-fast robots. Minigames are fairly basic and straightforward, and only loosely related to the rest of the adventure. The attempt to fit a submarine minigame in an otherwise standard 3D platformer especially felt somewhat out of place, but ultimately these diversions serve as a nice palate cleanser in between 2D levels and make for easily replayable challenges. Although formulaic, when it makes great use of its new mechanics and evokes classic Sonic gameplay, Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice is a competent and enjoyable adventure. The ability to replay levels and minigames to improve scores or use a character’s unique ability to explore more of a map offers enough incentive to dive back in, and the mix of classic Sonic platforming elements with newfound twists gives the game a more novel identity unto itself. Compared to the many missteps in Sonic’s history, it’s a decent example of what the series could be in a modern context. But when measured solely on its merits as a platformer, Fire and Ice is a repetitive yet competent game that's slightly above average.  ","Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice will introduce more adventure, speed, exploration, and an all-new fire and ice gameplay element that will help propel the action.",6.2
113,Tamoor Hussain,Mature,7,Batman: Arkham VR,"Oct 11, 2016"," Batman: Arkham VR is short, its gameplay is rudimentary, and its story retreads old ground. But it also has moments that--for fans of the Dark Knight--are the ultimate expression of wish fulfillment. Like many, I have a personal connection to Batman. My childhood was spent watching him on screens and reading him on pages. In my young adult years, channeling a Bruce Wayne state of mind helped me overcome a number of health issues. So when Arkham VR placed me into the living room of Wayne Manor, lowered me into its stately bowels, and dropped me into the Batcave, the sense of being fully immersed in a world I know so intimately stirred emotions within me like no other game has. This immersion in Gotham City is Batman: Arkham VR's biggest strength, but at the same time, it's impossible to ignore how shallow my interactions with the world were. The hour or so it takes to finish the game is made up of the kind of perfunctory motion-controlled gameplay seen in early Wii games. Using the PlayStation Move controllers, I poked at buttons to boot computers, flicked Batarangs at switches, and shot the Grapnel Gun to pull in items. It's agency at its most elementary. The two most significant gameplay sections involve investigating a crime scene and conducting an autopsy. The crime scene investigation plays out much like it did in Batman: Arkham Origins, with players scrubbing backwards and forwards through an augmented reality reenactment of the crime to piece together the events. To unravel what transpired, Batman uses an evidence scanner, which you physically pull out from your utility belt. The device is used like a flashlight to locate and scan key pieces of information that push the investigation forward. Similarly, the autopsy section uses the evidence scanner's deep tissue and skeletal x-ray functions to locate specific items buried within corpses. It's all simple and, with hindsight, disposable. But those interactions aren't what Batman: Arkham VR is about, and that's not what stuck with me about it. It's the emotionally charged moments in between that left a lasting impression. The ones that leveraged my enduring love of the character and my familiarity with the world, but placed me at the heart of it. There's the bit where I lowered the Cowl over my face, then looked in a mirror and saw Batman staring back at me. It was a moment that gave me pause and, despite knowing I'm a grown man standing in a dark room with an absurd looking virtual reality headset strapped to my face, I believed I was Batman. For a minute, I was transported into Gotham City, and I was its greatest hero. I was totally enveloped in the world, and in those moments the shallow mechanics didn't matter. As I was lowered deeper underground, the metallic elevator gave way to a vast cavern. Bats fluttered through the air, their screeches just barely piercing through the sound of a crashing waterfall. To my left was the T-Rex statue from my adventure on Dinosaur Island. On the right was the giant penny that marks my tussle with the Penny Plunderer. I was in the Batcave, and it was overwhelming. I had seen this place countless times over my lifetime, but never like this. Never from this perspective. In the Batcave's garage, I summoned the Batmobile and it emerged on a platform, stopping right in front of my face. I could finally see what the Joker, Two-Face, and the many thugs in Gotham saw whenever Batman rocketed through the streets in pursuit of villainy. And at the touch of a button it transformed from the nimble Pursuit mode into the tank-like Battle mode. It was majestic, imposing, powerful. Arkham VR also let me get up close with heroes and villains that I'd only seen in flat planes up until that point. I could see every detail in Nightwing's chiseled jaw and his ripped gymnast's physique, or the gruesome appearance of villains that shan't be named. In the alley I was dipping into the scene, leaning around corners and over ledges, carefully scouring the environment and soaking up that grimy Gotham City atmosphere that I'd read so much about. I stared up into the sky at the iconic Batman symbol projected onto the clouds. And it made me smile. Batman: Arkham VR is barely a game. Of all the launch titles for PlayStation VR, it's likely to be the least mechanically driven, but that doesn't mean it has no value. While playing it, I was totally enveloped in the world, and in those moments the shallow mechanics didn't matter to me. I appreciate that this is a very subjective emotional response based on my lifelong obsession with the character, but it's also a glimpse into one of the greatest promises of VR: Its ability to transport us into alien worlds and blur the lines between what is real and what isn't. To give us the opportunity to sideline our real selves and absolutely inhabit characters we've dreamed of being since childhood. ","Batman: Arkham VR immerses players into the Dark Knight’s universe as they experience Gotham City through the eyes of the World’s Greatest Detective.  Delving deep into an all-new Batman: Arkham mystery, those who enter this virtual reality world must think like Batman and utilize his legendary gadgets to unravel a plot that threatens the lives of his closest allies.",6.8
114,Jimmy Thang,Mature,6,PlayStation VR WORLDS,"Oct 10, 2016"," Nintendo's Wii Sports was an excellent compilation of mini games that helped introduced people to the Wii and its particular take on motion controls. PlayStation VR Worlds attempts to do a similar job for Sony's new VR headset, with a collection of short experiences meant to highlight the power of the new piece of hardware. The first game I played was Ocean Descent, which is really more of a passive experience. The game places you in a virtual cage and slowly lowers you into the ocean. As you look up while you slowly descend into the abyss, you see the sun's rays piercing through the waves. It's a beautiful sight to behold. As you look around, you're surrounded by coral and all of its inhabitants. I felt awe and amazement seeing schools of fish and manta rays swim around me. There are three short segments within Ocean Descent, but the one that really stands out is Shark Encounter. Here, you're sent down to explore a wrecked submarine. As you approach the vessel, a massive great white shark appears off in the distance. At first, it merely swims around you, trying to get a sense of what you are. It doesn't take long before it musters enough courage to try and eat you. Seeing its sharp teeth rip away at your cage is horrifying, but in the best way possible. Despite being a completely passive experience, it's thrilling edge-of-your-seat entertainment and serves as a fantastic introduction to VR. Ocean Descent is a great showcase for your non-gaming relatives at family gatherings. But perhaps its biggest shortcoming is that it's, well, short. It will take roughly 15 minutes to breeze through everything Ocean Descent has to offer. The other downside is that it isn't interactive, which does hurt the immersion to a small degree. That's where The London Heist comes into play. You play as a mobster and go on an adventure to steal a diamond. Despite being a relatively physical demo that requires you to move, the London Heist is a seated experience. The game appropriately has you sitting down in a variety of scenarios, whether that’s because you're getting tortured by a mobster in a chair or shooting at bandits in a getaway van. While you can use a DualShock controller to play the game, as you'll physically have to pick up and shoot guns, it's really an experience designed with the Move controllers in mind. Picking up guns, shooting, and reloading all feel very natural using them. While the shooting feels fun and satisfying, one highlight for me was when a mobster pointed the barrel of his gun down at my face. It felt dangerously real and showcases the immersive power of VR. In a moment of hesitation, one of the characters ended up stabbing me to death. It felt disturbingly violent. So much so that I have no desire to experience it again. Without trying to give too much away, there's another scene towards the end of the game that forces you to choose who lives and dies between two characters. In a moment of hesitation, one of the characters ended up stabbing me to death. It felt disturbingly violent. So much so that I have no desire to experience it again. This is not a sensation that I've felt on a traditional 2D display. It also helps that the game has great production values and good acting. There are also four shooting ranges within the game, but you can really play through everything The London Heist offers in under an hour. The game's biggest problem is that there isn’t enough of it. Another mini-game is called Danger Ball. It's basically Pong in 3D, except you use your head to hit the ball towards an AI opponent. The game has you floating in the middle of a Tron-like arena and there are eight different enemy types, each with their own abilities. Dupe, for instance, might shoot two balls at you for every ball that you hit at it. Tornado, on the other hand, will spin the ball back towards you. Whoever gets five points first wins and it can get really hard, almost unfairly so at times. While Danger Ball is mildly fun, it would be much more enjoyable with multiplayer, which it lacks. What I didn't enjoy at all is Scavenger's Odyssey. In the game, you're an alien scavenger who pilots a spider-like mech. The game's space setting is reminiscent of the original Metroid Prime, albeit more generic. There's a simple story that really just serves as an excuse for you to rummage through abandoned spaceships and asteroids to blast alien bugs with your cannons. Trying to track down where this constantly moving baddie was only made me more sick. The uneasy feeling stayed with me over an hour after I took off the headset. It’s less-than-original backdrop isn't the game's biggest problem, however. Scavenger Odyssey made me really motion sick. You move around using the DualShock's twin sticks, and if movement were simply relegated to moving across a flat plane, I think I would be fine, but the game also has you climbing up vertical walls like a spider and leaping from floating meteor to floating meteor. The jumping just made me feel really queasy. Towards the end of the game, you fight a giant flying worm-like boss, who loves flying across the screen. Trying to track down where this constantly moving baddie was only made me more sick. The uneasy feeling stayed with me over an hour after I took off the headset. The last game in the compilation is VR Luge, which doesn’t require you to use any controllers. The game has you sliding down busy highways on a street luge board. An ideal way to play the game is lying down on a bean bag chair. There’s even legs rendered in front of you that act as a virtual surrogate for your own body. VR Luge is effectively a checkpoint-style racing game where you steer with your head. The goal is to try your best to move forward while avoiding cars and oncoming obstacles. Throughout the four levels, rocks will fall from cliffs and trucks will drop logs for you to swerve around. While it's a little dizzying, VR Luge's biggest problem is that it feels like a polished tech demo. It might be fun once or twice, or to show your friends when they come over, but it's not something you're likely to play for hours on end. PlayStation VR Worlds is a game with really high highs and really low lows. Ocean Descent and The London Heist are great introductory VR experiences that I think everyone should try, whether they're into games or not. Their biggest downfall is that they're both really short. Scavenger Odyssey, on the other hand, just made me motion sick. Overall, its a collection of novel but insubstantial tech demos.  ",,7
115,Peter Brown,Everyone 10+,9,Thumper,"Oct 10, 2016"," Despite recent efforts to revive brands like Rock Band and Amplitude, there's a general sense that we've been there and done that when it comes to rhythm games. The staleness of the genre was a concern going into Thumper. It's a game that runs on rails, where you have to time button presses to match a beat that grows increasingly fast and complex over time, with the primary gimmick being that it's layered with trippy visuals. But those details don't tell the whole story. Thumper is like most rhythm games you've played before, but it's also a powerful, moving experience--especially in VR--that stands out as something completely different from its forebears. Imagine for a second that you're a chrome-plated beetle participating in a life-or-death luge race set in a tangled web of undulating cables, iridescent halos, and laser beams. In one ear, the menacing sound of taiko drums bang away, while the other is fed oppressive industrial riffs and beats. The tracks are dangerously slick and fast, and the only way to survive is to give yourself up to the beat--allow it to command your instincts to lean into sudden turns and hit markers at the right time. Anything short of a total bond between yourself and the track will lead to dimmed reflexes resulting in life-ending collisions. Success is surviving long enough to meet the the boss--a disembodied flaming head with piercing eyes and spiked florets emerging from all sides. He beckons, you respond, and you pray your muscles can react fast enough beat him senseless at his own game, matching every beat he sends your way. Granted, that may sound like a creative way to interpret what amounts to a simple rhythm game, but just because it sounds fantastical and flowery doesn't mean it's purely imaginative. You aren't challenged to create music in Thumper as much as you are to keep up with the obstacles it dictates; what amounts to beats or notes in other games is treated differently here. Most of the time, you're forced to act in other ways--at an incredible rate of speed. When taking a steep curve, you have to press a button and move the analog stick to grind the wall. Fail to hold the turn long enough or hit the correct button, and you crash. Spiked sections require you to jump, while a series of barriers can only be passed when you hold down the ""beat"" button. You may also find your track expand to multiple lanes while a phalanx of technopedes float into your path, forcing you to shift from side to side without hesitation. The big difference here is that you aren't forced to fill in a song to succeed. For example, you aren't always required to hit a button when a beat icon--for lack of a better term--appears on a track. The two exceptions are during the boss battle at the end of each stage and when a ring floats around the track waiting to punish you with an unavoidable attack for missing your mark under its watch. But these moments arise infrequently. Thumper is about survival under the guidance of music--and less about actually creating music. Beats and notes telegraph incoming obstacles, planting a seed in your subconscious only fractions of a second before you have to react. Tuning into this is critical during later levels where unavoidable obstacles fly by a mile a minute, and the process is thrilling to see in action as you frantically react, somehow survive, and ultimately inform the depth of the song at hand. If you hesitate to take action even in the slightest, Thumper will make short work of you. It's dangerously fast. In the span of a single second, you may have to take three turns, jump over a pit, and slam down from midair on top of an incoming beat marker. There are optional opportunities to improve your score or rating--such as jumping to hit floating rings--but making unnecessary moves is like tempting fate. Fail to input the correct button combinations at the precise moments that actually matter, and you're liable to hit a barrier, lose your sense of the beat and the track, and careen into a wall. That said, when you take the chance and come out unscathed, it's thoroughly rewarding to know that you went above and beyond Thumper's already challenging demands. Immersion is a tall claim, but it’s one that Thumper realizes. As a game that's playable both on a TV and in VR, this really only holds true for the latter, but again, it's a step above most ""immersive"" experiences we've seen before. Thumper thumps, bangs, and pummels you with intense percussion. It's as if you're facing the front lines of an army that intimidates their enemies with massive drums, and when things are at their most intense, it lays into you with high-pitched, droning sounds that rake at your psyche. Enveloped in corridors of light or swimming in a sea of darkness where faint, mechanical devils perform an intimidating dance, Thumper is truly captivating to behold, moving at commanding rate of speed that's difficult to shake. During a moment of solace, you may realize that you don't remember exactly what happened in the preceding moments. Yet there you are, speeding down the track to your next death-defying performance. Thumper's only hang-up is the repeated use of musical measures or track designs. Each level, which is divided into a few dozen segments on average, occasionally bears too strong of a resemblance to past stages. This issue is softened due to the effective nature of the game at large, but when it happens, you can't help but wonder what could have been given a little more musical variety. It sounds odd to claim that a lack of consistently original music wouldn't be a major problem for a rhythm game, but music isn't the point. Thumper thrives due to the way it marries speed, simple controls, and mesmerizing atmosphere. It's far more convincing in VR, where you're enveloped in the game's space and free of distractions from the outside world, but it shouldn't be ignored by those without the appropriate hardware. Thumper, no matter how you play it, is too good to miss.  ","Thumper is rhythm violence: classic rhythm-action, blistering speed, and brutal physicality.",7
116,Peter Brown,Everyone,6,SuperHyperCube,"Oct 10, 2016"," SuperHyperCube is a game that is both at home and imprisoned in VR. Set in a dreamlike space composed of geometric patterns and streaks of color, it eschews the touchstones of reality in favor of atmosphere that tickles the senses with special effects. Yet despite the case put forth by its hypnotizing sights and sounds, SuperHyperCube isn't the sort of game that could only ""work"" in VR. The demanding puzzle game within leverages the tech in a flimsy way--controlling the camera with your head--that ultimately makes your task more difficult with no apparent benefit. In mechanical terms, the way it utilizes VR could be accounted for by tilting an analog stick on a regular controller. Unfortunately, you don't have that option because SuperHyperCube can only be played in VR and controller-based camera movements aren't possible. Your challenge is to rotate a cluster of cubes--moving forward at a constant rate--so that its silhouette matches a hole in a wall, allowing it to cleanly pass through to the other side. The cluster is easy to manage at first, but upon each trip through a wall, increasing amounts of cubes are tacked on to form a disordered group, and what was once a simple task becomes a frantic race to decipher the hole and your cluster before the two meet. The steady progression from simple to complex shapes creates a gratifying learning curve at first, but there's a catch: As your cluster balloons in size, it gets more difficult to see upcoming walls--and holes--in detail without physically craning your neck around the virtual cluster. Walls eventually begin to rotate, adding a timing element that makes your job just a little more difficult. Once you determine the correct orientation for your cluster, you have the option to boost, filling a gauge that feeds into a slo-mo ability that buys you more time before the cluster meets the wall. If you choose not to use the slo-mo trick, you can continue to boost and fill up a second meter--a bomb--that will blow up an incoming wall and skip to the next round. This is a bonus that's typically earned over the course of multiple rounds, but as you spend more and more time manipulating your cluster in search of the right orientation in later levels, you generally have less time to boost (and thus fill) these meters. Special abilities are difficult to rely upon--and thus something of an afterthought as you struggle to make sense of your ever-growing cluster. It's immediately apparent that SuperHyperCube is a simple game, but that plays to its advantage. You only need to understand a few rules, and you're ready to go. The only barrier to success is your ability to comprehend complex shapes under mounting pressure. The random nature of your cluster from game to game makes each successive playthrough feel fresh, but when you hit a mental limit and the cluster becomes near incomprehensible in your mind's eye, your only chance at success boils down to making frantic rotations. Even if you manage to save a special ability for a truly difficult wall, the next one you face will prove even more difficult than the one you just cleared. This realization is disappointing because the sights and sounds that envelop you while playing SuperHyperCube are an enticing lure to which to return, and the concept that drives the puzzles is conceptually brilliant. But even after a few hours of practice, it's tough to break new ground when you're dealing with such complex, unwieldy shapes. There comes a point when it feels futile to push yourself to play over and over again in the hopes that you'll somehow learn new tactics in the face of such limited options. SuperHyperCube feels more like a bite-sized, meditative experience that requires a bit of luck, rather than a game that calls purely upon skill or knowledge. It's a game you want to love, but it's also one that keeps itself at arm's length.",,0
117,Peter Brown,Mature,5,Until Dawn: Rush of Blood,"Dec 31, 2015"," As a simulation of a trip through a house of horrors, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood gets the basics right. There's blood, murderous bad guys, and abandoned, decrepit structures around every corner. Rather than meander on foot, you sit in a cart on rails that automatically moves forward through these demented environments. At first, you're in a proper set of horrific-but-safe scenes, armed with air pistols, but it doesn't take long for the game to give way to more ""realistic"" threats and issue shotguns and revolvers in favor of toys. Though it transforms and tries to evoke true horror, Rush of Blood remains a benign experience that fails to elicit real fear; it's ultimately a basic light-gun-like game with jump scares you can see coming a mile away. With a PlayStation Move controller in each hand--simulating two guns--and a PlayStation VR headset on your noggin, your primary task is to keep an eye out for bad guys that either run directly at you or throw objects from the safety of cover. Aim, fire, and reload as quickly as you can, or you might end up dying from a few unfortunate hits. Should you die, you respawn in close proximity--the one exception is the ""Insane"" difficulty setting, which forces you to restart a level when you die. If you don't have Move controllers, you can play with a DualShock 4 alone, but it causes your two guns to move in unison, which dramatically detracts from the shooting-gallery appeal while also limiting your capabilities in practice. Levels include gruesome warehouses filled with squealing, dismembered pig carcasses, a haunted mental hospital with ghastly figures that dart in and out of sight, and a run-down carnival with sections of spooky woodlands. The game includes seven levels in total, but they tend to bleed together; Until Blood is fairly consistent in the tone and atmosphere of its settings, up until the vastly different final level that veers into the fiery depths of hell. They're dreadful, occasionally gross, and last about 10 to 15 minutes apiece. As you trundle through shadows and murky frights, you're accosted by the usual cast of horror baddies: thugs in clown masks, animated mannequins, zombie-like fiends, and spiders--arachnophobes, beware. With decent motion tracking in effect, aiming your shots comes naturally after a few minutes, and you quickly learn how to react to threats in front of you and in your peripheral vision. During some scenes, you must frantically react to succeed, but a keen eye and a calm disposition is all that's required once you understand the relationship between the PS Move controller and your virtual guns. You can temporarily acquire a small selection of powerful weapons hidden in colorful boxes, but they only prove necessary during the game's final encounter and otherwise serve as a way to add much-needed variety. Most enemies follow routines and are generally easy to kill--bad guys afar pop in and out of cover, and incoming foes simply sidle up to your cart if you don't shoot them right away, making for truly easy targets. There's one ghastly miniboss that sprints to and fro, making it difficult to hit from a distance, but all you have to do is wait for it to get in your face, fire a couple of rounds into it, and repeat the process until she's dust. Rush of Blood's other threats come in the form of obstacles that intrude upon your personal space. To avoid them, you simply need to lean to one side--or duck. Granted, the cart moves quickly during some sequences, and you have to react accordingly, but you typically have plenty of warning, since the cart moves slow and steady. Obstacles in Rush of Blood feel like nothing more than filler; they aren't scary, and they don't pose a meaningful threat. Should you choose to play for a place on Rush of Blood's online leaderboards, every level is packed with otherwise inconsequential props that you can shoot for bonus points, denoted by red-white-and-blue target decals. These make for decent target practice while you're waiting for the next action set piece, but again, they’ll mean everything or nothing depending upon your desire to replay levels and outdo other players' scores. Rush of Blood can be completed in roughly an hour and a half, and though you can unlock a few alternate paths in a couple of levels, they generally lead to more of the same--just in a different arrangement. Rush of Blood has a disturbing flavor overall, but that alone can't save what amounts to a largely predictable experience filled with straightforward action, dumb enemies, and predictable frights.

118,Miguel Concepcion,Everyone,7,Paper Mario: Color Splash,"Oct 7, 2016"," Paper Mario: Color Splash puts a new spin on the ""Mario Paint"" idea. Reminiscent of the adhesive gimmickry of Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Color Splash’s main appeal hinges on the joys of painting blank spaces with reckless abandon. This dependence on game mechanics that aren’t traditionally associated with Paper Mario appears to be indicative of a series that does not want to rely on its 2D charms alone. With that in mind, it's all the more surprising that painting isn't Color Splash's standout feature. The game begins with a troubling mystery, one involving a missing Toad, a blank letter in the shape of Toad, and a postmark from a seaside resort, Port Prisma. It's immensely refreshing to kick off the first hour of a Mario game without a Princess Peach kidnapping, but--spoiler!--she does get abducted eventually. There's more to this story than just a Toad rescue, though. Port Prisma and its surrounding vacation spots have been invaded by a sadistic contingent of Shy Guys. Their lungs are especially large, using straws to suck the color and life out of the environment--and worse, Port Prisma's locals, who are mostly unfortunate Toads. As usual, Mario's up to the task of saving the day, but not without a special color-splashing hammer and the guidance of a floating, talking paint bucket named Huey. As gorgeous as the series had looked on the 3DS--first with Sticker Star and then the Paper Jam crossover--seeing Paper Mario return to a console is an opportunity to see the series' stationery aesthetic in all its textured, subtly shadowed glory. Like Yoshi's Woolly World and Kirby's Epic Yarn, Color Splash's best visual moments are when you have the urge to reach out to your TV screen for a tactile sensation that isn't there. Some backgrounds even look like the thick paper stock used in high-priced greeting cards. The creative ways different paper products are used can provoke chuckles, whether it's toilet paper that operates a water wheel or blocky background objects decorated in well-folded gift wrapping. A modest grouping of two dozen strips of green paper can effectively and cleverly convey the visual of a small field of tall grass--and corrugated cardboard has never looked more gorgeous in a video game. Exploring the 39 other areas beyond the starting hub of Port Prisma reveals the usual gamut of Mario environments, from icy locales to humid tropics. This sense of familiarity doesn't hinder the enjoyment of traveling through these environments, however, since there's more than enough detail and imagination to keep your playthrough from feeling stale. The biggest challenge you'll face in the initial hour is in having enough paint to thoroughly color the first few regions. Your hammer can only hold so much paint and select areas will use up one of your three main colors, which are red, blue, or yellow. The best short term solution is to smash colored objects for a few droplets of their respective color. This issue is remedied as you progressively enhance your paint hammer to hold more paint. Hammer experience points, in the form of hammer icons, can be picked up as part of a post-battle loot drop. By the time you've cleared 20 or so stages, running out of paint won't be a concern. You'll also have access to other hammers, like a type that lacks paint capabilities you so can whack enemies without losing paint as well as a hammer that unrolls paper bridges. Seeing Paper Mario return to a console is an opportunity to see the series' stationery aesthetic in all its textured, subtly shadowed glory. Your primary tools for fighting, though, are combat cards--each one represents an attack or defensive action. Provided you're competent at managing your cards, it's easy to have a capable combat deck without having to buy additional cards at a shop. And unlike the last few Mario & Luigi RPGs (Paper Mario's sibling series), timing high damage attacks is much less challenging. This is due in part to Color Splash's training dojo, which allows you to learn how to time strikes without sacrificing cards. Even with more than 150 cards, you can count on variants of an attack type to all function the same way--just with different degrees of potency. Jumping on a Goomba with an iron boot is as easy as jumping on it with a beat-up boot. Aside from timing attacks and blocks, the other stimulating aspect of battling comes from picking the right card attack for the right opponent. For example, it would be inadvisable to use a beat-up boot to jump on a foe with a spiked helmet. It's pleasingly apt that you can employ tactics that go as far back as the original Super Mario Bros., such as using a Koopa shell to clear out a row of enemies. Echoing an over-the-top assault from a Final Fantasy summons, some attacks are hilariously excessive--like an electric fan that's as large as the planet. It's easy to feel guilty when using it to blow away a trio of Shy Guys. Navigating in and around 2D structures in a 3D plane has always been one of Paper Mario's main draws, thanks to the obstacles that a given area presents. Color Splash doesn't task you with as much spatial manipulation as Super Paper Mario did almost a decade ago on the Wii, but you will make leaps in and out of the foreground and far background planes. Craftiness is needed for many of the puzzles--and that includes not limiting your viewpoint to the default, side-scrolling camera. For instance, some monochromatic 3D objects aren't completely repainted unless you go behind them. Shy Guys will also surprise you from time to time by manipulating your surroundings to their advantage, such as rolling up a path in the foreground in order to trap you. The way Color Splash keeps track of all the monochromatic areas you've colorized, plus the myriad environmental puzzles, creates considerable eplay value. It's impossible to earn a 100 percent colorization credit in any of the game's early sections on your initial visits, given that you haven't unlocked the abilities or cards to access each stage's hard-to-reach areas. At its most imaginative, Color Splash's visual gags and thoughtful manipulation of 2D objects rival any ""wow"" moment from Sony's Tearaway games. Where Paper Splash stumbles is with many of Mario and Huey's exercises in backdrop cutouts. By literally cutting sections of the background, Mario can surmount roadblocks and bypass large gaps. The trick lies in figuring out where these detours are. Some of these removable backgrounds are revealed through visual hints, but many are difficult to spot. It's mildly annoying having to spam the Cutout ability in the hopes that a dotted line--the traditional guiding line for scissors--will appear. Constantly pressing a button with no sense of direction hardly feels rewarding, even if the result is forward progress. Color Splash's seemingly limitless gang of Toads offer a wide spectrum of personalities. Most are enthusiastic about assisting Mario, while others are precious as they plead to him for help. One standout citizen is a glasses-wearing Toad whose card-collecting zest perfectly portrays him as a lovable (albeit stereotypical) nerd. Unsurprisingly, however, Toads don't have a monopoly on charm in the game. The Shy Guys--the dominant enemy type in Color Splash--occasionally have their heartwarming moments, too. They're precious when they fall over themselves in battle and are amusing conversationalists while they wait in line at a trendy Toad-run coffee shop. In all, conversing with these endearing characters, mushroom-headed or otherwise, is a joy, especially since many of these chats are often snappy. It's as if Nintendo has been mindful of the criticisms directed at prior Mario RPGs for their verbose, drawn-out conversations. Jokes don't solely rely on referential humor or puns; sometimes an amusing, G-rated expletive like ""What the scrap?!"" is all it takes to make a particular Toad memorable. At its most imaginative, Color Splash's visual gags and thoughtful manipulation of 2D objects rival any ""wow"" moment from Sony's Tearaway games. What Color Splash lacks in moment-to-moment paper tricks, it more than makes up for in persistent visual appeal and a wholly adorable cast, including antagonists from all pay grades. Its only frustrating feature is its Cutout interface, which can leave one stumped, disrupting the game's pacing and enjoyment of levels considerably. The novelty of the paint splashing doesn't grow tiresome, but it does take a backseat to the visual allure for which the series is known. Color Splash makes a solid case for a Paper Mario sequel that doesn’t need to rely on shtick like stickers or paint, though I won't be surprised if Nintendo’s considering using crayons in the future.

119,Alexa Ray Corriea,Everyone 10+,5,Yo-Kai Watch 2,"Sep 30, 2016"," You’d be forgiven for confusing the latest addition to the Yo-kai Watch series--a set of sequels with minor differences named Yo-kai Watch 2: Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls--for its original predecessor. That's because Yo-kai Watch 2, first released in Japan in 2014 and now only having reached North America, is nearly a carbon copy of the 2013 original. The sequel's opening hours retread the same plot and yo-kai encounters of its predecessor, with its main--and new--story finally becoming clear after more than 10 hours of recycled fetch quests and stale ideas. And aside from a few minor tweaks to combat and significantly additions to Yo-kai Watch lore, there's not much incentive to dig into Yo-kai Watch 2 if you played the first game. The story begins when the protagonist--you can again choose between a young boy or girl--wakes up with the events of the previous game erased from their memory. You rediscover Whisper, the exuberant ghostly butler that accompanied you in the first game, and set about your daily life relearning all the same basic taming tricks from the first game. It feels like a lazy narrative choice to hit the memory-reset button on the main character for the sake of plot, especially when the first Yo-kai Watch did an excellent job of world-building at a strong, steady pace. Yo-kai Watch 2 also adds a time-travel element to its already unevenly paced narrative, making the entire affair feel a little too cliched. One great addition to Yo-kai Watch 2's world-building is the addition of new areas. Wider sections of your hometown of Springdale are open to explore, and new towns beyond its borders are accessible by train. Unfortunately, riding the in-game train is much the same as a real one--you have to wait for long stretches of time between stops on the way to your location--and it’s a drag on the action. Once you discover teleportation points, however, this becomes a moot point. However, most portals aren't found until much later in the game. Most of Yo-kai Watch 2's main missions are, just as in its predecessor, fetch quests. The game features a few small additions meant to change things up, such as environmental puzzles where one misstep will send you back to the start of the maze or pop quizzes meant to test your knowledge of yo-kai. But even these can't save the main thread from monotony. After I spent more than a dozen hours running from one end of Springdale to the other searching for a Spritzer or a certain type of yo-kai, my enjoyment of the world and my patience ran thin. Even the boss battles against gargantuan and some particularly clever yo-kai waiting at the end of these quests couldn't save me from boredom. Combat in Yo-kai Watch 2 is identical to that in the first game. The bottom screen of the 3DS displays a six-spoked wheel, displaying the yo-kai in your possession. Three are on the battlefield at any time, and you can rotate the wheel to change up your active party. Once again, setting yo-kai of the same elemental type next to each other will net you bonuses in battle, such as dealing extra damage or moving more quickly. The fighting system is still mostly passive, and sometimes you can win a battle without pressing a single button. Yo-kai attack on their own, with very little input; you can press a button to queue up a minigame that charges a yo-kai's most powerful Soultimate attack or play a similar minigame to purify a yo-kai that’s been possessed by an enemy. This all becomes rote very quickly, with the only exception being boss battles. Most have a weak spot on them that can be targeted with the tap of a stylus, and you must plan your attack strategy around breaking down this specific area. Once weakened, a boss becomes more susceptible to your attacks, and since some of these battles have multiple stages, it's a good idea to plan ahead rather than leave chance in the hands of the passive battle system. Once again, I found myself frustrated most by the lack of guidance in successfully recruiting yo-kai into my party. After a random encounter, there's a certain likelihood that an enemy yo-kai will approach and ask to be your friend. This possibility is increased by giving the yo-kai its favorite food in battle--but what that food could be is never made clear or recorded anywhere, even in Yo-kai Watch 2's in-game Yo-kai Pad. Late in the game, my yo-kai collection was woefully lacking, since I‘d already grown weary of the trial-and-error practice of throwing one of every food in my inventory at every creature I saw. Yo-kai Watch 2's most welcome additions are multiplayer battles and trading. Like in the Pokemon games, players can match online to test their yo-kai's skills outside of the single-player section. Unfortunately, the same issue in single-player battles is present here, with most fights able to play out without any player input. And trading's best boon is allowing players on each version of the game--Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls--to swap and collect yo-kai exclusive to each version. Yo-kai Watch 2 does preserve the quirky tone and charming writing that made the first game so engaging, but its lack of iteration is problematic in that there aren't enough fresh ideas to color its monotonous gameplay. The game feels old hat, taking you through well-trod ground--albeit with a fresh coat of paint and a few new faces. If you're a fan of the original Yo-kai Watch and feel invested in its world, then the lore laid down in Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls is worth toying around with in the nearly two-dozen hours you'll spend in the campaign. But if you're looking for something original, you should pass on Yo-kai Watch 2.",,7.5
120,Mike Mahardy,Mature,7,Gears of War 4,"Oct 11, 2016"," In many ways, Gears of War 4 knows exactly what makes the series great to begin with, and capitalizes on those strengths in myriad areas. In other respects, however, the sequel feels like a misstep as the Gears franchise continues on its storied path. The result is a fractured mix of inspiration, exhilaration, and irritation. The storyline follows JD Fenix, son of series regular Marcus Fenix, as he battles a new subterranean threat and the Coalition of Ordered Governments, an organization that has taken a sinister turn since the original Gears of War trilogy. The younger Fenix travels with new characters Kait and Del, both of whom reveal backgrounds and familial ties as the plot progresses. Unfortunately, much of this narrative feels forced or predictable. The Gears franchise has always hidden a quality story beneath its macho jargon and shallow jokes, but new studio The Coalition doesn't find much depth in its storytelling: the humor is irritating, romances emerge on an insincere whim, and I never felt as if the characters actually cared about each other. Dialogue serves mainly as exposition, without the nuances that could otherwise flesh out complex relationships among the cast. Vistas are gorgeous and character designs portray a ragged society eeking out a living in a post-Gears of War 3 world, but there's not much emotional substance among the wreckage. What's more, the actual gameplay suffers from pacing and redundancy problems throughout the campaign. The first two hours are the most abrasive, throwing multitudes of simple enemies at JD and his gang as they chew through the waves with conventional weapons in boring situations. It takes several chapters until firefights evolve past simple point-and-shoot scenarios. But even then, the campaign seems intent on repeating situations time and time again: turret defense sequences, frantic fights against weaker, nimble enemies, and the simple act of clearing an area before a loud gong beckons you to the next skirmish. This lack of inspiration is all the more frustrating considering the engaging scenarios that do emerge. Gears of War 4 introduces several mini-bosses that demand a new approach to the franchise's tried-and-true combat, and mitigate the feeling of deja vu as the chapters pass. There are also several campaign sections that make use of Gears of War 4's new Horde mode, planting it directly in the narrative during defensive scenarios with JD and his squad. And Gears of War 4's Horde mode is fantastic. Whereas Gears of War 3's overextended itself, trying too hard to expound upon a solid formula, the wave-defense mode has found both confidence and creativity in its newest iteration. There's a handful of new mini-bosses that arrive on the scene every tenth wave to pound you with artillery or charge your position with claws raised. They wreck fortifications you've built, and shatter your best laid plans. The new Horde mode leads to some of the best cooperative situations in the series Rather than have you build turrets in set locations, Horde now gives you a fabricator, a portable station that lets you buy weapons and defenses to build strongholds around the map. This is all done through a currency called Power, which drops when you kill enemies. This small wrinkle is one of the new Horde mode's greatest additions. It forces your team to emerge from the safety of your barricades to gather every last bit of Power, forcing you out of your comfort zone and placing you in danger, should you choose to scavenge before the current wave ends. There's even a character class called the Scout devoted to gathering currency for your team. Yes, Gears of War 4 also introduces upgradeable character classes to the Horde formula, asking you to fill a role on a team of up to five players. There's a Sniper, a Heavy, and an Engineer devoted to maintaining defensive emplacements. While classes seem like a forced addition on paper, they result in some of the best cooperative scenarios I've seen in the Gears of War franchise. During one wave, my teammates and I were hunkered down in a well-fortified position on an abandoned farm. We had survived 19 rounds so far, had numerous upgraded turrets that our Engineer was repairing, and our sniper was flush with long-range ammo. However, when wave 20 arrived, so too did a Snatcher, a massive enemy that can swallow players whole before escaping to finish them for good. The enemy rendered our defenses useless--we had to leave our makeshift base, spring around the map, and pick off smaller enemies before killing the Snatcher. All hell broke loose as we did our best to maintain some semblance of a team amidst the panic. Gears of War 4's Versus section displays the same quality craftsmanship as its wave-based counterpart. There are a host of minor improvements to the way you control your character, and they're all the more apparent when playing against other human players--you can now slide into cover, vault smoothly over barriers, and, most notably, rip enemies over walls when positioned correctly. It removes many of the repetitive stalemates that occurred throughout the original trilogy's multiplayer modes. Of the new modes present in Gears of War 4, several showcase a more arcade-y side to the franchise's player vs. player combat. Arms Race grants each team specific weapons as they progress through the match, demanding new strategies as you cycle from the explosive Boomshot, to the close-range Gnasher shotgun, to the final weapon, the Boltok pistol. My personal favorite mode, however, is Dodgeball. As in its real-world counterpart, you have the chance to tag teammates back into the match after they've been eliminated, simply by removing one of your opponents. It's a battle of attrition where one player can turn the tide, changing a three vs. one match into an even bout, or turning the tables completely to gain the upper hand. It's worth noting that Gears of War 4 suffers from some technical issues, in both its multiplayer and story modes. Certain objectives didn't trigger during my campaign, forcing me to restart the last checkpoint and replay sometimes boring chapters. The game also froze several times in the menus as it tried to load a match, or even just the next menu page. These problems don't ruin the overall experience, but they're irritating enough to cast a pallor over some of the game's sections. That serves as a microcosm for the entirety of Gears of War 4. This is a shooter teetering on the edge of something greater, but despite the improvements it makes to the storied franchise, its missteps hold it back. There is inspiration here, and creativity in the way Gears of War 4 rethinks its multiplayer modes. But the lackluster campaign and technical issues are blights on an otherwise exhilarating shooter. The result is a whole that doesn't reflect the quality of its often stellar parts.",Gears of War 4 is the next installment in the Gears of War series and is exclusive to the Xbox One.,8.6
121,Scott Butterworth,Teen,7,Battlezone,"Oct 13, 2016"," After being ported and rebooted many, many times since its initial release way back in 1980, Atari's classic first-person hover tank shooter may have at last reached its final form. As a cockpit-based game set in a digital, Tron-like world, Battlezone is a natural fit for VR, a platform that excels at immersing players in seated experiences. And at its core, Battlezone VR's classic, straight-forward gameplay works on Sony's new VR machine (especially since the game utilizes a traditional Dualshock controller rather than Sony's Move wands). Persistent, unavoidable frustrations drag the experience down at times, but playing with friends ameliorates many of those issues. Battlezone's only mode is a procedurally generated campaign. Once you select your desired difficulty and duration, the game generates a board of hexagonal tiles. Each tile is a mission, which means you can--to an extremely limited extent--choose what you play as you make your way from the starting point to the eventual final stage. Along the way, you can stop off at supply station tiles to purchase new weapons with the currency you earn in-game. But there's a risk: every time you move to a new tile, your enemy's power increases, eventually spawning one or more nigh-unbeatable boss characters that stalk the board until you beat the campaign. Ultimately, the tile meta-game doesn't actually allow for much strategy, especially since the game contains only a handful of unoriginal mission types--defend the base, defend the convoy, attack the comms tower, and so on. You can also avoid the super boss with relative ease, or even track down hidden towers within missions to decrease your enemy's overall power and negate that larger threat altogether. While both could have been better, neither the lack of strategy in the meta-game nor the repetitive missions detract too deeply from my overall enjoyment. But the punishing life system certainly can. Battlezone VR's structure borrows certain ideas from roguelikes. For example, if you run out of respawns, the campaign is not only over, it's gone forever. You have to start over on a completely new board. Thankfully, when you're playing with friends, you can heal and revive each other by parking alongside your injured comrade's tank, and in combat, you employ team tactics like spreading out and forcing powerful turrets to focus on just one of you. It's fast, it's fun, it works. But when you're playing solo, you have none of those luxuries. And while Battlezone VR might have worked just as well without the ""VR,"" it does make the most of Sony's headset. You have no way to heal, you run out of ammo far more frequently, and you end up spending a huge chunk of your currency purchasing extra lives rather than weapons and upgrades. It's possible to survive solo if you're extremely methodical and patient, but the gameplay is most fun when you're boosting out of the way of fire and whipping missiles at your enemies on the fly. When you slow all that down in order to increase your chances of long-term survival, the fun falls off a cliff. Every reload becomes painful, extended checkpoint-less missions feels like punishment--the entire experience becomes a chore. When you're not desperately clinging to every sliver of health, however, you can instead focus on enjoying the arcadey action. Enemy AI is relatively dull, but the various enemy tanks and airships still present a threat if you're careless--and blasting them into dazzling piles of glowing shards proves immensely satisfying regardless. And though heavier weapons would have felt a bit more impactful with bigger sound effects and a bit of recoil, the aiming mechanics still function smoothly enough to keep combat feeling intuitive and fun. It'd be nice to have gameplay options beyond simply ""shoot everything that moves,"" but Battlezone VR is, if nothing else, true to its roots. It would also be nice if Battlezone VR offered other modes beyond its campaign. The game does not currently contain a competitive multiplayer mode, which is a shame since human opponents would undoubtedly be more interesting to battle than the relatively rote AI. Still, the game finds other ways to up its replay value. Beating a campaign, for example, is only the beginning. As soon as you're done, you can start again on a new board on a higher difficulty (if you so choose) and try out whatever new tanks and weapons you unlocked by succeeding on your previous playthrough. And while Battlezone VR might have worked just as well without the ""VR,"" it does make the most of Sony's headset. Being able to swivel your head to view your surroundings is an immersive touch that provides practical benefits as well, like being able to survey the battlefield while still aiming at whatever's in front of you. You can also glance around your detailed cockpit to check for info that would generally be included in an intrusive heads-up display. The environment's massive geometric towers communicate a sense of scale best enjoyed in VR, and thankfully, the tanks hover gracefully enough that motion sickness never became an issue during my time with the game. It's hard to heap unconditional praise on Battlezone VR, but even with all the caveats outlined above, there's still plenty of enjoyment to be found in its challenging co-op action. It's true to the arcade original, capitalizes on its platform of choice, and provides a fully-formed experience--which is more than you can say about some VR titles. The draconian solo play, unimpressive AI, and repetitive missions stymie the fun to an extent, but with friends, Battlezone VR successfully scratches a nostalgic itch an exciting new way.

122,Alexa Ray Corriea,Everyone 10+,9,Rez,"Jan 7, 2002"," Some games are timeless. Rez is one of them. Set in a cyberspace landscape riddled with bugs, you guide your tiny figure on a quest to awaken the mysterious being lying dormant within in. To get to her, you must shoot through hordes of technicolor, swirling viruses that lob projectiles and try to block your path. But it's not the narrative that makes this game incomparable; Rez is a rail shooter on paper and a heart-pounding synesthesia joyride in practice. Rez Infinite, the updated remake designed for the PlayStation 4 and PSVR, is still the same game as the original Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 version, albeit with a little more visual flourish. Backgrounds that were once hazy have been replaced with updated, crystal clear pieces of the cyberworld. Colors are brighter, lines sharper. Enemies drift in and out of your field of view with a new smoothness. And in VR, Rez Infinite allows you to dive deeper into its world in ways previously impossible. To navigate Rez, you need only concern yourself with aiming and shooting, as you remain on rails moving at a set speed at all times. While holding down the X button you use the left stick--or in VR, the headset's motion tracking--to highlight the enemy or enemies with a targeting reticle, then release the button to fire your shot. Rez encourages you to chain hits together by cluttering your field of view with opponents, making picking them off one by one not an option. And this isn't as simple as it sounds, given enemies come flying at you from every direction at all once, and that's not even counting the additional projectiles they toss your way. Shooting sounds are replaced with claps or beats, and successfully destroying enemies results in a flood of musical tones. You can pick off your opponents in time with the beat, or create your own discordant melodies--it's entirely up to your own rhythm. Occasionally you'll collect clusters of bright white and blue pixels that allow you to charge up. Collect enough of these and you level up, taking on a new form--for example, at one stage you evolve from a floating silver figure to a red and black figure seated cross-legged within a sphere. Additionally, collecting these white pixels and rare red ones charges up your Overdrive, a powerful attack that can clear the screen of enemies in seconds and comes especially handy during a boss encounter. When rushing bosses, you must locate and target the core object of an undulating, vibrating cluster of tiles and lights to dismantle one area of the cyberspace prison. These are the most complex and challenging sections of Rez, and often include multiple stages. One boss collects squares around its core and takes on the form of a running figure that chases you through hallways. Another is a swirling sphere, with tentacle-like arms that break up and try to whip you as you fly by. These boss battles are also a visual treat, and with Rez Infinite's upgraded graphics it feels more like attending a rave in Tron than a fight. And then there's Area X. Rez isn't about shooting and conquering, it's about creating music. And nowhere is this concept stronger than in a new mode unlocked after completing all five main campaign areas. Area X removes the rails and sets you off into space, allowing you to fly in any direction you wish. In doing this, Rez Infinite grants you more power in manipulating your space; you can fly closer to or away from enemies, skirt around giant structures shimmering in the surrounding darkness, or simply fly around in circles and let the beat play out around you. You can maneuver around the space in a way that lines up enemies and objects exactly how you want them, then unleash a torrent of tones following your own rhythm. I played through Area X several times and never found the same rhythm twice--going after the pink, squid-like enemies and leaving a giant flying dragon-like creature alone for a while produced a different sound that when I went directly for the dragon and followed it around the space, a tiny silvery shadow in its starry wake. But playing the game in VR places Rez in what feels like its final form. In the original areas one through five, as you glide through these cyberspaces, you can look up, down, and behind you for a greater view of the world you inhabit. This new freedom of movement for your field of vision also allows you a second chance at enemies that have floated out of your path; in several cases being able to look directly behind me assisted in my takedown of a boss. This wider field of movement lets you more quickly dispatch enemies, and in this way it makes the game a bit easier (especially that pesky running boss). But Area X in VR is the perfect coupling. I spent time flying off in the stars and gazing down on the musical chaos below me, before rocketing down and zipping between shiny pink projectiles as I moved in to pick off a particularly large enemy that dropped the beat as it dissipated into nothing. This feels like the natural evolution of Rez, and I have to imagine this could be how creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi saw his creation from the beginning. The full sensory immersion elicits a sensation beyond the simple toe-tapping and head-bobbing that comes from playing the original Rez. Rez Infinite's Area X in VR engages your entire body, thumping your synapses in time with the music and forcing you to move. I felt connected to my tiny being on screen, doling out a symphony with fireworks in my wake. Despite it's short campaign--you can complete everything in a little more than an hour, if you're skilled--Rez Infinite is the game to buy a PSVR for. It's hypnotic and enveloping. And it's transformative, both within itself and in the wider scheme of the experiences made possible by VR. You don't want to sleep on Rez Infinite, because with the addition of more polished visual flair and the dreamy Area X, we have a new classic for the new generation on our hands.","On paper, UGA's ""music shooter"" may sound a little dull, but it's one of those games that simply must be seen--and in this case, heard--to be fully understood.",8.6
123,GameSpot Staff,,8,Atlas Reactor,"Oct 4, 2016"," ""Checkmate,"" I typed in chat, just as the my beefy warrior hero Titus slammed down his broadsword and killed the two shooters before him. Victory and game over. But ""checkmate"" is an apt enough word to use when playing this game. Atlas Reactor's cast might be filled with the likes of robo-puppies and gun-toting fishmen rather than sword-swingers or wooden pawns, but watching a match feels much like watching the ancient game of chess. It retains this feeling even with a host of influences--a bit of XCOM here, a dash of League of Legends there--and a multiplayer focus that pits two teams of four players against each other. It maintains a near-perfect balance of match length, tactics, replayability, and flow of action, and comes off as something unique and fresh. It's also turn-based, a design choice that initially comes off a poor bedfellow for its PvP emphasis. But the greatness of Atlas Reactor is that it works, in part because there's little waiting involved. Every player gets only 20 seconds to plan and position their next moves over a gridded map, and every player does this planning phase at the same time. The action winds up right as those 20 seconds wind down, and the moves play out on the map down lanes and conveniently placed walls. And then, tick-tock, it's time to start again, and this dance plays on for either 20 total turns or until one side kills five players. And as if to prove that Atlas Reactor seriously has a thing for the number 20, most matches last no more than that many minutes, which comes as a blessing when things aren't going well. Even with the decent tutorial, it's daunting for the first few matches. Once it kicks off, the action unfolds in a series of phases, all of which you have to account for with a library of five abilities within the space of 20 seconds. First, there's the Prep phase, which sees your hero lay down traps (or shout to weaken opponents, as my warrior Titus does). Right after that comes the Dash phase, which lets you dart out of the way if you're worried another player is about to unleash a big attack. That’s followed by the Attack phase proper, where you fire rocket launchers, unleash huge mechanical choppers, or swing greatswords depending on the hero. After all that comes the Movement phase, which lets your hero move to a new area in preparation for a new attack. Adding to the mix is a wide range of options for taking cover, power-ups for damage and health, three single-use ""catalysts"" for healing and short teleports, and a fog of war mechanic that lets you hide from enemies on specific tiles. Spelled out like that, it sounds comically unwieldy for the time allotted, but it makes sense in action. At least one of those abilities is an ultimate that can't be used unless you've amassed enough energy, and distance limitations often rule out certain abilities. At least half the time, I'd say, I'd locked in my moves before the 20-second timer even ran out. Much as in chess, a big chunk of the fun comes from guessing how the next turn plays out. I might have Titus ready to charge at an enemy player with low health on the other side of the map, but if he or she dashes away, I could end up swatting at air when I arrive. Or maybe there's a weakened enemy who could last a bit longer by picking up that nearby health pack, but I could thwart his plans by nabbing it first. Some of the best moments come down to skillful gambling, such as betting that a couple of enemy players will dash into the catastrophic area-of-effect attack I'm about to unleash. Communication by voice or chat interface naturally makes all this easier, although I've been in plenty of winning matches where the only words I see typed are ""lol""s when massive attacks miss. Atlas Reactor is nice enough to make this process easier by automatically hooking you up with a Discord channel before each match if you choose, and voice chat does much to get the most out of those 20 seconds. Could the game offer a bit more variety? Certainly. As it stands, it doesn't take long to learn the tricks and secrets each of the few maps present, which may be a tiny part of the reason why many random players don't bother with voice chat. And it's a world I'd like to see more of. There's even a story of sorts with lively, humorous cutscenes that's largely currently locked behind the multi-week ""seasons,"" which unlock collectibles like banners and emblems. This is a lively, cel-shaded universe that echoes The Fifth Element and any number of other cyberpunk settings while a catchy soundtrack thumps its beats in the background, and its cast of ""freelancers"" look as though they could rub shoulders with the cast of Overwatch and fit right in. There are 21 freelancers, with Juno and her twin-cannon harness being the last added for launch after months of beta. More will no doubt fill the ranks eventually, but I already admire how much the experience changes and renews itself when going from my favorite Titus to Celeste (who can steal power-ups with grappling hooks) or the cutesy Quark, who smothers friends with heals but blasts the bad guys with gamma rays. Nor is it mindless shooting--tactics figure in heavily, such as the way one freelancer can bounce laser blasts off walls and shift-clicks allow for precise maneuvers around traps. Even the progression system doesn't let things get out of hand, as it merely focuses on mods for your abilities and catalysts, with extra taunts and skins tossed in for fun. And since Atlas Reactor espouses a buy-to-play model, you merely have to pay $30, and all this is yours. (After all the 20s, I'm surprised it's not $20.) It's a nice break from the sometimes-oppressive free-to-play model that’s defined Trion Worlds’ games lately, although if you're not ready to plunk down cash, you can use the Free Mode that switches out different heroes each week. Smartly, as with so many other things about this game, those heroes are randomized by account rather than game-wide so that you're not always seeing the same five pop up in matches. And if you ever want to jump in ranked or custom matches and open more loot crates so that it feels like more than a largely functional trial, just pay the 30 bucks. A lot of what gets passed off as ""innovation"" in games these days is really better described as the successful alchemy of numerous existing styles, but rarely does this practice produce the kind of gold we find in Atlas Reactor. Sure, it could use a few more maps (and more are on the way), and its learning curve is just steep enough that it's briefly tough to see the fun on the other side, but it achieves its aims with style and flair.

124,Jason D'Aprile,,5,Giant Machines 2017,"Sep 29, 2016"," If you’re obsessed with construction equipment and large mechanical things, Giant Machines 2017 probably has something to offer you. Giant Machines 2017 is a game that simulates what it’s like to drive, well, giant machines. These are machines like dump trucks, giant bucket-wheel mining excavators, cranes, and that massive moving platform that hauled the space shuttle to its launch site. I found the game bizarrely entertaining in short bursts. It’s buggy, not terribly attractive, and frequently requires the player to perform tedious, rather pointless tasks. Giant Machines brings up all kinds of questions about worker safety as well. Does the gigantic excavator really have a 300-foot ladder going straight up, with no safety guards whatsoever? And, if so, who takes that job? There's a certain novelty to the game as a whole. Similar to the appeal of movies about sharks in tornadoes, there's a goofy, yet earnest glee to playing with monster machinery. The 12-year-old in me couldn't help but get a modicum of guilty pleasure out of plowing through town in a dump truck the size of a house or pushing massive piles of snow for no real reason at all. The game's snarky narrator is also amusing as he gives you mission goals at the beginning of each level, frequently complaining about the incompetent guy who had the job before you. Despite the inherent glee of operating massive mechanical contraptions and snarky narrator aside, the game takes itself way too seriously and focuses too much on out-of-place mini-objectives. Anyone who looks at a game like this and thinks, “Hey! That’s a great idea!” is likely doing so because they want to bust things up with giant equipment. There’s some of that, but there’s way too much fixing cables, replacing batteries, and other tedious tasks that just get in the way of controlling the vehicles. When you finally do get behind the wheel of these mighty machines, the game opts for simulation-level pacing--without really delivering any kind of in-depth simulation. You can control almost every aspect of the various vehicles with a control pad, for instance, but don’t expect a riotous, over-the-top destructive rodeo. Instead, take a deep breath, contemplate life, and think about your day as you literally drive from Point A to Point B at about one or two miles per hour. The camera has an array of options, which are frequently all bad. Viewing from the operator’s booth in some of the machines barely lets you see what you’re doing, and the third-person viewpoints tend to be even worse. It’s not so noticeable when you’re driving a giant dump truck, but for unusually shaped vehicles (such as the excavator), everything is awkward. Every vehicle has a radio with several music stations. One sounds like weird '80s-era action-movie synthpop, while another seems to be Eastern European metal. It was all stuff I've certainly never heard before. The tracks aren't particularly good, but I kind of enjoyed the low-budget equivalent to the standard triple-A soundtrack. Adding ""2017"" to the name might suggest this is a modern, up-to-date experience, but the graphics engine looks more like 2006 (or older). The machines--especially from a distance--look decent, but the landscapes are sharp and blocky, and close-up textures and architecture are rather primitive. Giant Machines 2017 is only vaguely sim-like and suffers from a slew of flaws. Had the game just dove all-in on the idea of creating a destructive playground in which players could just run wild, it might've been a lot more appealing. As it is, the game has a distinct novelty value if you like low-budget, weird games.  ",,6.6
125,Brett Todd,Mature,5,Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour,"Oct 11, 2016"," The famous ""Come get some!"" line from Duke Nukem 3D served as a call to battle. This was a crewcut-sporting action hero who also wanted people to hail him as the king, so he wasn't exactly big on introspective moments. But now we've moved on to the 20th Anniversary World Tour edition of this revolutionary 1996 shooter, and I have to ask myself if I still want some of what the Duke is offering. And I'm afraid that I have to politely--and somewhat regretfully--decline. As much as the original game is one of my favorites from the golden age of PC gaming, this slightly enhanced, expanded revamp is worth little more than a brief look back to see how far we've come in the past two decades. And it's not like we haven’t been down this road before. Duke Nukem 3D has been re-released a number of times over the past 20 years, most recently as part of the encyclopedic Megaton Edition that hit Steam in early 2013 but has since been pulled offline to make way for this new version. 20th Anniversary World Tour is slightly different from other re-releases, though. For starters, this edition contains some visual and audio refinements. The appearance of every level has been subtly improved, and new lighting gives the game a cleaner, less murky look--although everything's still very pixelated, to the point where enemies morph into chunky blobs of color when they get close. You can freely flip between the old and new visuals, which lets you see just how superior the lighting is today. Still, it's tough to pick out fine details in level architecture, which can lead to some scavenger hunts to find the way forward. This was a problem back in the day, and it remains one now. As with the graphics, the core sounds and music have been cleaned up to simply sound better while not losing the 1990s charm of the original effects. And original Duke Nukem 3D voice actor Jon St. John has re-recorded all of the Duke’s iconic quips and added a few new ones, giving new life to the game’s action-movie-hero vibe. But the new visual features are a little understated. A more thorough visual remastering would've made the game a little easier on the eyes--and more acceptable to a modern audience. As it is, the game is ugly by today's standards, especially in close-quarters battles. Even if you like the retro-purist approach, it wouldn't have hurt to have provided more extreme graphical improvements so that gamers could make the call whether or not to go old school. Another big change is the addition of a new fifth episode titled Alien World Order. This chapter allows you to keep rolling with the Duke after the original conclusion of the game and battle the extraterrestrials in seven new levels set all over the globe. You blow up baddies in the seedy red-light district of Amsterdam, near Red Square in Moscow, through the tweedy laneways of London with Big Ben looming overhead, among the ruins of ancient Egypt in Cairo, in the quaint streets of Paris, alongside the devastated Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, and finally head back to Hollywood and outer space for a new boss battle (that doesn't carry anything close to the impact of the stadium battle that closed the original Duke Nukem 3D). Every level has been designed as it would've been back in 1996, with the same focus on finding your way through maze-like corridors, securing key cards to unlock doors, and, of course, blasting mobs of aliens. All of the new levels are challenging, and they slot in nicely with the originals. If you're playing the game in order--and you don't have to here, since everything is unlocked from the start of play--the new episode flows seamlessly from the old ones. But you have to really be committed to the original game (and its now-very-dated style of play) to fully appreciate these new levels. I was initially impressed by just how much the developers nailed the particular design sensibilities of the original Duke Nukem 3D--but then became annoyed by how little they sought to improve things. Level design is labyrinthine in too many places, and searching for the key cards needed to open doors just grew steadily more annoying as I plugged through Duke’s world tour. Taken together, the old and new levels reminded me of how odd the original Duke Nukem 3D was. It had all the superficial trappings of a run-and-gun shooter but also intricate, maze-like level design with a ton of interactive features (including some decidedly non-politically correct moments that helped make the game such gleeful, raunchy fun). Even though there’s a lot of content offered up here, it isn't as complete a package as the one offered just a couple of years ago on Steam. One final noteworthy change between the 20th Anniversary World Tour take on Duke Nukem 3D and some of its preceding re-releases is the amount of content. While the 2013 Megaton edition collected all of the original Duke Nukem 3D content, including the Duke It Out in D.C., Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach, and Duke: Nuclear Winter expansion packs released in the late '90s, this one features just the core four episodes from the original Atomic Edition of the game from late 1996 and the new episode described above. So even though there’s a lot of content here, it isn't as complete a package as the one offered just a couple of years ago on Steam. Not much else distinguishes the 20th Anniversary Duke Nukem 3D from its predecessors. A commentary option lets you get the skinny on various parts of the original levels, though there isn't much of it, and the comments seem to mostly focus on the beginning levels of each episode. The game also includes full multiplayer along with Workshop support for homemade user maps. Finally, it features the innovative replay-slider save system that lets you rewind the action to any just-played point in the level every time you die. Even though I wanted to love Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour, if even just to dig into the nostalgia evoked by replaying a game that absorbed a lot of my spare time in 1996, the only emotion aroused was a sense of amazement at just how far shooters have come in terms of graphics, immersion, and level design in 20 years. The Duke may forever be the king, but he's the king of 1996, and his game is so set in a particular time and place that it should probably be left there.  ",,9.6
126,Scott Butterworth,Mature,6,Mafia III,"Oct 7, 2016"," There's something undeniably special about Mafia III. The New Orleans-inspired setting and vintage '60s soundtrack combine with the incredibly rich narrative to create a sense of immersion not often found in triple-A games. At one point, I was shooting my way out of a swampy section of the Louisiana bayou to the tune of Del Shannon's ""Runaway"" and just thought, ""This is the coolest scene ever."" But that feeling, unfortunately, never extended to the rest of the game. Though Mafia III's campaign contains quite a few memorable moments like that bayou shootout, they're buried under a pile of repetitive filler missions and underserved by dated gameplay, which adds little to the standard sandbox shooter formula we've seen in dozens of other games. And worse still, the game suffers technical blemishes from start to finish. The story follows Lincoln Clay, a man who is many things: an orphan adopted by the leader of New Bordeaux's black mob, a war hero who returns home from Vietnam in 1968, and the victim of a vicious betrayal at the hands of the city's crime boss, Sal Marcano. The ensuing plot follows all the expected beats of a revenge tale, but it culminates in a positively Shakespearean ending made all the more impactful by our deep understanding of each and every character. The story mixes cutscenes set in 1968 with documentary footage shot in the present day and video of a Congressional hearing that occurs somewhere in between. It's a brilliant way to tell a complete, well-rounded story. Even side characters receive enough attention to feel three-dimensional, and tiny details like store signage and radio hosts expertly capture the tumultuous time and place that serves as the backdrop. You'll even find a few nods to longtime Mafia fans. Mafia II protagonist Vito Scaletta, for example, returns as one of three underbosses who allies with Lincoln against Marcano. Lincoln's quest for revenge coincides with his rise to power, power he shares during a series of playable ""sitdowns""--scenes in which Lincoln gathers his capos around a table to talk business. Basically, every time you capture a new district, you must assign that district a leader, who will grant you new weapons and abilities in exchange. But ignore one of your partners too many times and they might just turn on you. It's a clever way to embrace the ""mafia"" concept and a welcome strategic contrast to the rest of the gun-driven gameplay. Unfortunately, the sitdowns work better in concept than in practice, in part because the perks aren't particularly well balanced. Vito and Cassandra offer plenty of desirable perks like a time-saving money collection service and improved ammo capacity for all weapons. Burke, on the other hand, can temporarily call off the cops, but oddly enough, I never found the cops to be much of a problem. Neglecting Burke became a foregone conclusion after the first couple meetings. While the sitdowns aren't a resounding success, they are, at least, a compelling, original idea. The rest of Mafia III's gameplay, however, feels entirely unoriginal. The action consists primarily of bare bones driving and third-person, cover-based shooting, both of which we've seen executed better in other games. The gameplay is functional and even enjoyable at times, mostly thanks to the Hitman-light stealth mechanics, cinematic scripted takedowns, and gruesome yet satisfying enemy death animations. But Mafia III does nothing to distinguish its generic moment-to-moment gameplay from that of other sandbox shooters, and its core mechanics can't even nail the basics--at least not completely. Swapping cover feels awkward, enemy AI is dumb as rocks, weapons lack variety--none of this breaks the experience, but it does land the overall quality somewhere between ""fine"" and ""lackluster."" These problems are compounded by the campaign's exhausting mission structure. After the game's excellent opening portion, a pattern quickly emerges: shakedown informants, kill enforcers, smash up contraband, steal cash stashes, and, eventually, take down a boss figure. It's a pattern that makes sense in the context of the world, and those boss showdowns provide many of the game's most unique and memorable gameplay scenarios. Problem is, that pattern repeats over and over again for the entire campaign, and the filler missions leading up to the bigger faceoffs never change. As a result, much of the game feels frustratingly repetitive. And while the city of New Bordeaux is immense, alive, and incredibly detailed, there's not much to do beyond the story missions. There's also no fast travel system, so I spent an infuriating amount of time just commuting to and from objectives. These issues are somewhat forgivable in light of the exceptional storytelling--which kept me invested throughout--but it's impossible to overlook Mafia III's technical problems. I experienced everything from broken mission objectives to enemies spotting me through walls to a solid handful of hard crashes. And that's all in addition to the fact that the game simply doesn't look that great, with blurry textures, odd lighting, and object pop-in throughout. Though I encountered the bulk of these issues while playing through the campaign on Xbox One, I can confirm they also affect the PS4 and PC versions, though most problems seemed slightly less severe on those platforms. Every aspect of Mafia III's writing--from the dialogue to the mission descriptions--is excellent. The obvious care and craftsmanship that went into its narrative elements should serve as a model for all other triple-A titles. The gameplay, however, just can't live up, and repetitive missions and technical problems drag the experience down further, turning a game that could have been truly great into one that has to settle for ""fair.""","Mafia III introduces Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam veteran in New Orleans.",6.5
127,Randolph Ramsay,Everyone 10+,7,Skylanders Imaginators,"Oct 16, 2016"," I've always thought of the Skylanders series as gateway titles for the next generation of gamers, with the series' kid-friendly aesthetic and forgiving difficulty serving as gentle introductions to the wider world of games. Skylanders Imaginators is, in that sense, an obvious, almost inevitable next step. With Imaginators, the Skylanders go further along along the gaming evolutionary path, adding RPG-like staples such as full character customisation, loot drops, and a more complex stats system for your weapons/gear. It's a welcome move for the franchise, as it adds a compelling twist to the tried-and-true Skylanders formula. It's an twist that's ended up being the redeeming quality for for this latest instalment. Imaginators is, at its core, a pretty standard action platformer, and it comes up lacking when compared to the more varied and vividly imaginative recent games in the series (Superchargers and Trap Team). But that new level of customisation and the ability to constantly tinker with your character makes it feel like a different experience. This makes Imaginators the most interesting Skylanders to play in years, even if it's not the most fun. It all starts with characters, or in this case, the ability to create your own Skylander from scratch. To create a Skylander, you're going to need a creation crystal, one of the new sets of physical toys that will debut with this year's game. Like other Skylander toys, placing a creation crystal on the real-world Skylanders portal will bring whatever character is saved onto the crystal into your game. Each crystal has a specific element attached to it (such as life, earth, undead, and so on), and the first thing you'll have to choose is what class you want your new Skylander to be. These classes fit gaming's broad archetypes such as brawlers, ranged specialists, mages, and more, and are forever locked once you make your initial decision (you can, however, change your character's looks at any time). This is where the tricky topic of commerce in the Skylanders series enters the conversation. Choosing a character class is actually a pretty big decision in Imaginators, as the classes are distinct enough that your playstyle will be impacted by class. I played most of the game as a Bazooker class, which specialises in ranged explosives, and switching over to a more melee-focused Brawler class at certain points forced me to significantly alter my approach to combat situations. Of course, with your class locked to a creation crystal, you'll need to buy more if you want to play as any of the others. Buying new toys to experience more of the game is a Skylanders tradition, and while there's a huge amount of content here that can be accessed with just the basic starter packs, that commercial element of the franchise remains the same. To its credit, the game doesn't limit your ability to change how your character looks at any point. Imaginators doesn't quite have the same level of customisation depth as say, something like a WWE 2K17 or a Skyrim, but what is there is pretty expansive. You can choose body parts from a wide selection of preset choices, tinker with the coloring of individual pieces, select the pitch and tone of your character's voice, change their battle music, and more. All of this customisation makes for a system where you can create a Skylander that feels pretty unique, and that you can easily get attached to because of the level of care you can pour into its creation. My favorite piece of customisation was the ability to change catchphrases; it always brought a smile to my face every time Nuggets, my Bazooker character, screamed out ""I'm crazy for my muscles"" before heading into battle. Your created characters can equip weapons and gear, and while gear isn't anything new in a Skylanders game, the frequency of drops has significantly increased, making the loot experience here more akin to a less intense version of a Diablo or Destiny. Defeating bosses, completing objectives, or even just making it to certain areas all result in dropped chests that contain loot (ranked common, rare, epic, or ultimate), and this loot isn't restricted to just gear. New body parts, catchphrases, and even sound effects will also drop, giving you the option to continually tinker with your character's look if you feel the urge to do so. My seven-year-old son--who I played a lot of the Imaginators campaign with--certainly did, and he would continually (or more accurately, annoyingly) stop to equip a new shoulder guard, or swap in a new tail for his character, or change the size and shape of said character completely. As for me, the tinkering became fairly infrequent as the game wore on. Outside of the novelty of a cool new body part, I found little reason to swap out gear and weapons (the only things that actually make a difference to your character's stats) after the halfway point in the game, thanks to generous drops that bestowed several ultimate-level pieces of loot fairly early on. A better, more restrictive loot drop system would make Imaginators a more compelling experience for grown-up gamers, but from my focus group of one (ie, my son), the target audience seems to be in love with the constant stop-and-swap feel that this game provides. It's a pity, then, that all of this customisation is limited to your created characters, and not to the wider cast of both new and existing Skylanders. There's no way to equip any of the dropped gear or weapons on any non-player created characters, so any old Skylander toys you may have don't benefit from the most significant additions that Imaginators brings. The new range of figures released for this year's game--called Senseis--do feature special ultimate moves that are both flashy and impactful, but compared to the cool new personalisation options you have with created characters, the Senseis and any plain old Skylanders come off as rather dull. If it wasn't for the customisation options and the constant allure of what the next loot drop will bring, Imaginators too would come off as a little dull. That's not to say it's boring; Imaginators' lengthy campaign is a pleasing enough romp, but it's one that leans a little heavily on tried and true action platformer tropes. Simple puzzles, basic platforming, and multi-stage boss fights abound, and there are only a few instances where Imaginators breaks out of this traditional mold. It's not groundbreaking in any sense, and certainly feels like the most rote Skylanders experience in a while. A better, more restrictive loot drop system would make Imaginators a more compelling experience for grown-up gamers. But that new level of character personalisation elevates Imaginators from being decidedly average. The game also allows you to take your character into the real world, with a phone app that allows you take your console creation and order actual t-shirts, physical cards (that contains your character data and act like a Skylander toy when you place it on a portal), and even a 3D-printed toy (apparently in very limited quantities). It's not something I've tried yet, but given the close bond I feel with my character Nuggets, it may be something I do soon. With Imaginators, the Skylanders series isn't pushing any gaming boundaries, but at least it has character.",Use the power of your imagination to create Imaginator Skylanders to battle in the ultimate adventure alongside the almighty Senseis to save Skylands.,7
128,Mat Paget,Rating Pending,8,Shadow Warrior 2,"Oct 13, 2016"," Shadow Warrior 2 nails many important aspects of being a first-person action experience. It allows you to move quickly and precisely as you shoot a wide variety of enemies with powerful guns and slice them up with piercing blades. But as a game that puts such a large focus on comedy, it stumbles and falls with jokes that are more lame than they are funny. Of course, dick jokes--which are the basis for a lot of the humor here--aren't automatically bad, but Shadow Warrior 2 delivers entry-level one-liners that don't strive for more than reading thesaurus entries for male genitalia. You play as Lo Wang, a foul-mouthed assassin who makes constant dick jokes and works for whoever pays him the most. This time around, he's hired to save a girl named Kamiko from an insidious corporation. The premise sounds simple, but it quickly takes a turn for the absurd. Kamiko's body becomes possessed and her soul ends up inside Wang's head via an act of mysticism to protect her. She can't stand him or his terrible jokes, and they both want her back in her own body, so you set out on a quest to do exactly that. Shadow Warrior 2 infuses quests, skill trees, and loot into its first-person action. You level up, upgrade your skills, and find new and stronger weapons you equip through the game's vast, clunky menus. These menus are overwhelming with the amount of information they present, but once you get accustomed to the clumsy UI, you get to the main focus of the game: killing a substantial number of baddies with guns, blades, and chainsaws. Enemies run the gamut from gargantuan demons to small, levitating drones. Many of Shadow Warrior 2's enemies rush straight at you, forcing you to act quickly. There are a number of movement options, such as dashes and double jumps, that allow for quick movement around environments. And instead of just contributing to fleeing tricky situations, these dashes add to the combat in thrilling ways. Dipping in and out, then sticking a foe with your blade when they leave themselves open makes you feel like you're faster and more skilled than your enemies. Some enemies attack you from afar, and simply shooting them with a rifle is an effective-yet-unsatisfying method to deal with them. A more exciting approach? Dashing from side to side to dodge an enemy's ranged assault as you close the gap and punish them with your katana. The more you put into Shadow Warrior 2's combat, the more you get back. Spending the entire game relying solely on one sword will make its numerous combat scenarios wear thin fast. Trading the strike of a katana for a devastating shotgun blast, on the other hand, will keep things fresh, and the game provides plenty of tools in your arsenal with which to experiment. Just about every weapon feels good to use, too, whether it's the fast flurry of the glaive-like blade or the slow-but-destructive path of the railgun. The chainsaw is equal parts grotesque and awesome; pulling the motorized weapon through an enemy delivers just enough resistance to make this slower, more damaging melee option exciting to use. Shadow Warrior 2 is at its best at higher difficulties, when death is more likely to be an arm's length away. Adding a friend in co-op mode delivers a similar experience to what you get in solo play, but it allows you to bump up the difficulty even higher, which makes the game more exciting (especially when you're up against bosses and tougher enemies). Playing quests that the game warns might be too hard is also a gripping experience, not one littered with overwhelming annoyances. Once you beat the game, you start over with all the skills and upgrades you've collected, and you can play whatever sidequests you may have missed out on during your initial run. The game's movement and combat is a lot of fun to play around with, but the story ends much more quickly than expected, with a boss fight that's uncharacteristically tedious and frustrating, requiring you to run around in circles while you shoot a stationary target. Shadow Warrior 2 is peppered with lame one-liners and awful jokes that almost always revolve around a penis. The jokey dialogue delivered by an obnoxious cast can veer off into other vulgar topics, but it always comes back to a pun on the word ""wang."" Some of the one-liners you'll hear frequently in combat include, ""Mess with the bull, you get the wang"" and ""This is my rifle, this is my wang."" More jokes await you in the cutscenes, and the pause for them in every conversation makes the already interminable sequences feel like they take twice as long. It's the lack of creativity--and the fact that every character is unlikable--that hurts this game the most. Thankfully for Shadow Warrior 2, it's still a great game to play. Picking off enemies one-by-one with a railgun, demolishing them point-blank with a shotgun, and ripping through them with a chainsaw are just a few of the exciting moments that make it hard to put down. However, if you want to experience its action-packed highs, then disregard its groan-inducing lows and skip the cutscenes.","Shadow Warrior 2 is the evolution of Flying Wild Hog's offbeat first-person shooter following the further misadventures of former corporate shogun Lo Wang. Now surviving as a reclusive mercenary on the edge of a corrupted world, the formidable warrior must again wield a devastating combination of guns, blades, magic and wit to strike down the demonic legions overwhelming the world.",8.1
129,Justin Haywald,Teen,6,RIGS: Mechanized Combat League,"Oct 13, 2016"," Virtual reality has the potential to make some game types better: storytelling can be more immersive, the jump scares of horror can be more frightening. However, fast-paced first-person games in VR have generally only succeeded at making me feel nauseated. But the PlayStation VR-exclusive RIGS Mechanized Combat League proves even that genre can work in the confines of a headset. RIGS has serious flaws in execution, but it nails the fundamentals of movement in VR in a way no other game I've experienced has. At its core, RIGS is a first-person shooter where you pilot a robotic mech through sprawling, multi-tiered arenas across three primary modes: Team Takedown (team deathmatch), Endzone (a capture-the-flag-meets-American-football variant), and Power Slam (the game's unique and most interesting mode). In Power Slam, you destroy opponents or collect orbs scattered around each arena to enter a powered-up Overdrive mode, after which you can jump through a large ring in the center of the map to score points for your team. The concept sounds complicated and weird, though the deathmatch-meets-basketball mashup is genuinely fun. But the number of camera and comfort options are what truly make racing across the game's maps and leaping through the air to score aerial takedowns feel so natural. When you turn and look around, the field of view around you, but without diminishing your peripheral view too drastically. When you get ejected from your rig, you can enjoy the flight up in the air where you'll choose your next respawn point, or just let the game momentarily black out the background while you soar upwards. And the ability to use your head to move around and aim, while disconcerting at first, is what makes the entire VR experience come together. You can always opt for a more traditional twin-stick controller setup, but the responsiveness of the game's head-tracking allows for almost mouse and keyboard-like precision (and the fairly generous aim-assist helps too). There's both a single-player and multiplayer campaign, and both are built around completing a set number of matches to complete a ""season."" The overall rank you earn--designated by the number of new fans you acquire after each match--carries across both online and off. And through increasing your rank, you can hire stronger AI teammates (though they also demand more of the reward pot for each match). But the matches too frequently felt lopsided. I faced computer opponents who sometimes offered an exciting challenge, while others either completely crushed my team or fell to double-digit losses. But the pace of the matches are perfect--an endless, unpausing march of the game's clock that gets you in and out of the action in 10 minutes. When you can find a match, the game really shines mode. It's more fun to play against human opponents than the game's inconsistent AI, you can actively coordinate with your real-life teammates, and, you can swap out your RIG in-between matches (in the offline mode, you have to back out to the game's garage to change your RIG). And, outside of sometimes seeing a delay between the start of a match and my teammates appearing, there's no noticeable lag or similar technical issues when playing online. However, actually getting into a match can be an insurmountable chore; I haven't been able to start a full 3v3 match on any mode except Team Takedown since the game's launch. The wait might not be so bad if there was something to do while you waited, but there's nothing to do on the loading screen except look around the main menu hub--and that oppressive wait is compounded by the fact that you're isolated inside a VR headset. It's funny that the part of RIGS that forces you to take a break with the headset off isn't the intensity of combat, it’s the boringness of the loading screen. RIGSs combat is about quick matches and intense shootouts, but lots of little additions continually drag down that sense of speed. Each match starts with the same laborious screen where you and your teammates get loaded into your mech, and every single time after you finish a match, you're forced to watch a completely pointless dance animation from the MVP of the match. Every. Single. Time. Regardless of whether it's you, a teammate, or the opposition, you can't skip it, and it just gets more and more irksome when you're itching to jump into another match. And RIGS shows that same lack of urgency in the way you unlock the game's mechs. RIGS seems to keep things simple by giving you four core models to choose from: the small and agile Hunter, the airborne Tempest, the tank-like Sentinel, and the balanced Mirage. But then for each mech type, there is another subset of classes, each with a separate perk--like leaving leaving a martyr-like bomb behind when your RIG explodes or regaining health for taking down enemies. Then on top of the perks, the weapon loadout for each mech is different and locked to that specific mech. Outside of the first mech you earn, you have to purchase each additional one with in-game funds. You earn funds pretty quickly both online and off--every few matches you earn enough to buy another mech--but it's a tedious system that makes nailing down which mech combination is right for you unnecessarily complicated. And it also makes figuring out exactly how weapons work more of a chore, since there is such a wide assortment of different armaments; after purchasing a new mech, you have to go into a separate training room to test it out. As a game that focuses on online competition, it just doesn't make sense all of the various mech types, abilities, and weapons aren't available from the beginning. The game's upgrades are equally ill-conceived. From the home menu, you can select ""sponsorships"" that task you with things like ""complete five melee takedowns"" or ""earn MVP twice"" and reward you with cosmetic upgrades like visors, uniforms, and helmets. But the rewards are only for your pilot, not your mech. And you can only choose two sponsorships at a time, one for your online campaign and one for offline; after completing a sponsorship, if you want to swap it out (and thus get a new reward), you have to back out to the main hub and cycle through another menu. You still earn lesser rewards for meeting the stipulations of the sponsorship a second time, but you only earn the bigger cosmetic one once. On top of that, you don't get a preview of the cosmetic rewards you can earn--basically, you don't know what you're working towards (beyond ""new visor"" or ""new suit"") until you earn it. The groundwork is here for an amazing first-person experience in VR. RIGS controls are top-notch, and aside from the grating, repetitive announcers, the arenas are colorful places that I love competing in. But the smaller details that RIGS stumbles over make it hard to justify continuing after completing an initial season. RIGS is a great showcase for how to make a VR shooter, but it's also a game that could learn from the ""less is more"" mantra.

130,Miguel Concepcion,Mature,9,Battlefield 1,"Oct 21, 2016"," Battlefield 1 wastes little time in conveying the savagery of World War 1. The inevitability of death is the focus of the bleak story prologue. A burning man’s screams can be heard at the start of every multiplayer match in the Argonne Forest. It’s ruination on a multi-continental scale, a conflict so large that its location menus showcase a large portion of the Earth. EA DICE splendidly interprets the early 20th century as a world in technological transition while humanizing the war's participants through well crafted, albeit fictional, narrative vignettes. Combined with an enthralling multiplayer component, the overall result is the studio’s best work since Battlefield: Bad Company 2. The horrors and heroism of The Great War are well told in War Stories, Battlefield 1’s campaign. It’s a more focused experience compared to prior Battlefield story modes of globetrotting and one-note powderkeg narratives. These new tales are organized in a non-linear anthology format that doesn’t need to be played in any particular order. You are exposed to a variety of perspectives from the characters you play, each with their own motivations, from altruistic to self-serving. And each tale is presented with distinct narrative flavor. The exploits of the mostly unlikeable Clyde Blackburn, for example, represent the stories that get mixed up in the chaos of war. This gambler and swindler leaves the events of his alleged adventure open to interpretation. His tale is an effective contrast to the somber post-war account of Luca Vincenzo Cocchiola, an armored Italian soldier tasked with protecting his twin brother from everything from bombers, shock troopers, flamethrowers, and more. Beyond these heartfelt tales of brotherhood and solemn reflection, War Stories gracefully complements the multiplayer scenarios as a glorified yet effective training mode. Along with practice time commanding vehicles and heavy artillery, it provides an opportunity to learn melee combat, as well as how to survive against high concentrations of enemy forces. It also presents scenarios that you wouldn't find online, such as valuable lessons in the ways of stalking enemies and how best to move wounded allies to the safety of cover. The vehicular sections of War Stories introduce you to the first generation of tanks and fighter aircraft that were the advanced warfare of their time. In “Through the Mud and Blood,” a Mark V tank is its own character, endearingly nicknamed Bess by its crew. Short on space though tanks may be, a carrier pigeon joins you for the ride, and proves to be a valuable passenger during one of the campaign’s most touching scenes. Battlefield 1’s multiplayer stays faithful to the series’ roots of open-space combat, now marvelously tailored with World War 1’s weapons, vehicles, and terrain. Its centerpiece, Operations, finds one side pushing forward while the other holds them back in conflicts that can last an hour. It’s not an emotionally draining endurance match, however; the changes in environments as the battle progresses keeps the fight fresh. A match can move across up to five areas across the same region, which is analogous to playing five different small maps. As a cavalry-inspired twist, the losing side gets two last ditch opportunities to win with the help of an airship, attack train, or a dreadnought. Operations also offers a surprising amount of historical context thanks to informative pre- and post-match voice over. For instance, the Kaiserschlacht operation not only broadly educates players on the 1918 Spring Offensive, it also hypothesizes what could have happened had the Germans won. Like a band of brothers reuniting, the reprise of Conquest, Domination, Rush, and Team Deathmatch delivers the goods for the Battlefield devotee. Beyond amassing the highest kill count or earning the best kill/death ratio, there’s a thrill in adapting to changing circumstances mid-battle. This is especially true for team players, who must constantly try to figure out how to be the best contributor. That could mean protecting a capture point or stopping an enemy charge by assaulting them from an airship. Lastly, War Pigeon--which has the hallmarks of a throwaway novelty mode--shares some fundamentals with Capture The Flag, where the bird serves as the flag. The challenge comes in finding a safe place to write a message for the bird to deliver, releasing the pigeon outdoors, and ensuring it doesn’t get shot down. A mode is only as good as the map it's based in and Battlefield 1's maps are all smart and interesting in their own ways. Peronne, with its mix of small town in ruins and untended fields, requires bit more time to memorize its layouts and strategically advantageous points. From the vacant French palace in Ballroom Blitz to the labyrinthine streets of Amiens, every locale has its own sense of character. This is aided by the inclusion of armed gargantuan machines like the airship and train. The Argonne Forest in particular--with its light mist, detailed vegetation, and man-made ruins--is one of the most gorgeous multiplayer maps ever conceived. Compared to the many near-symmetrical maps in Battlefield: Hardline, these new fields of operations feel natural and, more importantly, inviting. With Battlefield 1, EA and DICE have proven the viability of World War 1 as a time period worth revisiting. The series’ best maps are those that encourage you to play outside your comfort zone, to spend time with things you typically ignore and to play around with the available vehicles. The FAO Fortress in Mesopotamia and Monte Grappa in the Alps, for instance, are ideal maps to acquaint yourself with the exhilaration of sniping. The outstanding expansiveness of the maps and the abundance of routes in a given area create myriad opportunities to circumvent bottlenecks and camping spots. Challenges in navigation are found in the multiplayer menus. Getting into a match isn’t a problem, but the online UI isn’t very intuitive, particularly in defining some of the categories of unlockables. Furthermore, it’s disappointing that it’s not possible to leave the multiplayer mode in between matches; you actually have to wait until the next match starts before you can exit. But these minor issues do not dampen the overall experience. The robust and satisfying progression system is how you customize your online experience, where much of your arsenal is built on whatever you spend your level upgrade rewards on. Growing a collection of firearms is rewarding for veterans while the simplicity of most of the antiquated weapons makes the conflicts accessible to newcomers. It’s meat-and-potatoes 20th century combat; no drones or heat seeking bullets to concern yourself with. Every meaningful action is recognized--even dealing a flesh wound earns you experience points. You’ll have more armaments to choose from than your average World War I soldier, though, which is indicative of the creative liberties Battlefield 1 takes. However accurate or inaccurate Battlefield 1 is--lite J.J. Abrams lens effects notwithstanding--the immersive production values superbly amplify the sights and sounds that have previously existed in other war shooters. Examples include the distinct clatter of empty shells dropping on the metal floor of a tank and the delayed sound of an exploding balloon from far away. The brushed metal on a specific part of a revolver is the kind of eye-catching distraction that can get you killed. Beyond the usual cacophony of a 64-player match, salvos from tanks and artillery guns add bombast and bass to the large map match. And many vistas are accentuated with weather-affected lighting with dramatic results, like the blinding white sunlight that reflects off a lake after a rainstorm. With Battlefield 1, EA and DICE have proven the viability of World War 1 as a time period worth revisiting in first-person shooters. It brings into focus countries and nationalities that do not exist today while also shedding light on how the outcome of that war has shaped our lives. As World War II shooters proved many years ago, no game can truly capture the entirety of a global conflict. This is why the focused structure of the War Stories anthology works well. Moreover, Operations succeeds as an effective educational primer on the battles that this gripping adversarial mode are based on. Battlefield 1 is just an introduction to one of the deadliest world events in history, but it is an outstanding, feature-rich package in both its emotional stories and strong multiplayer.

131,Jimmy Thang,Everyone 10+,7,Eagle Flight,"Dec 31, 2016"," Eagle Flight is a first-person VR shooter set in a dilapidated version of Paris where you pilot an eagle using your head. If that isn’t quirky enough for you, it’s also a multiplayer-centric game where you shoot other eagles with supersonic screeches. I’m susceptible to virtual reality motion sickness and can gladly say that I felt completely comfortable playing Eagle Flight. There are a few tricks that Ubisoft implemented in the game to mitigate nausea. For instance, you turn using only your head, rather than a joystick. It feels pretty intuitive, too. The only thing that takes a little getting used to is tilting your head to make sharp turns, since this is not a movement that you’re likely to do in every-day life. Luckily, it took me less than an hour before it became second-nature. While the game requires a controller, you’ll only use it to slow down, speed up, attack, and shield yourself. While the main draw of the game is multiplayer, there is a single-player story mode. Eagle Flight takes place sometime in the future when Paris has inexplicably been abandoned by humans. Animals and vegetation have overrun the city. You’ll learn a little more about your environment from the game’s narrator, who is well-acted and takes on a nature documentary-esque tone. There are dozens of short, simple missions. Some will make you fly through consecutive floating rings scattered throughout the city, while others will have you racing against the clock through treacherous underground parts of Paris, like obstacle course-laden subways and catacombs. The game can get challenging because you can’t stop flying forward, and if you crash, you die and have to start missions over. As you progress through the game, you’ll be introduced to the aforementioned eagle screech attack, which you’ll use against other birds in escort-type missions. These levels can feel a bit unfair at times, as you quickly have to dispatch of numerous predators within a relatively short period of time. The campaign is pretty pedestrian overall and can be beaten in under four hours. The campaign is pretty pedestrian overall and can be beaten in under four hours. It ultimately feels like an elaborate training ground for the multiplayer, which is where the game is really able to spread its wings. Eagle Flight is a capture-the-flag game at its core. Two teams of up to three players must grab the carcass of a rabbit and bring it back to a nest. There is a surprising amount of depth. Because your screech attacks move slowly through the air, you’ll have to learn how to lead your shots. Diving down from above gives you a temporary speed boost. You can also fly into jet streams and between buildings to avoid enemy screeches. The environment can be just as dangerous as your enemies. Carelessly flying around may cause you to crash into a wall and drop the prey. You can also activate a temporary barrier to block attacks. It’s a silly and unrealistic mechanic, but it’s a fun and useful tool that adds a layer of strategy. Teamwork is also essential in Eagle Flight. When an ally has the flag, it’s important to fly close to your carcass-carrying ally to kill nearby enemies. Multiplayer can be thrilling, and as odd as it sounds, weaving between buildings at high speed while dodging enemy fire made me feel like Luke Skywalker piloting an X-Wing through trenches of the Death Star. Weaving between buildings at high speed while dodging enemy fire made me feel like Luke Skywalker piloting an X-Wing through trenches of the Death Star. The multiplayer isn’t perfect, however. Despite being modeled after Paris, the trees and buildings don’t feel very distinct. Eagle Flight’s multiplayer also lacks voice support, which is an odd omission given how important it is to work together. Finally, while Eagle Flight’s multiplayer is really fun, there’s only one mode to sink your talons into. Eagle Flight initially sounded like a kooky concept to me, but I can’t remember the last time I had this much fun playing capture-the-flag. The game has a surprising amount of depth, and it’s highly competitive as a result. There were multiple occasions when I couldn’t help but scream when an enemy eagle killed me as I was a beak’s length away from victory. And while the graphics aren’t amazing, just being able to quickly zip around Paris can be breathtaking. If you’re looking for a really fun multiplayer VR game, you should fly like an eagle.","Developed exclusively for VR, Eagle Flight sends you to the skies of one of the most visited cities to experience

132,Richard Wakeling,Teen,6,WWE 2K17,"Oct 11, 2016"," Since the shift to current-generation consoles, 2K's WWE series has steered away from the arcade-style formula of its extensive lineage. It's clear that developers Yuke's and Visual Concepts want to forge their own unique path to a simulation style of wrestling video game, iterating further and further in this direction with each passing installment. Much like last year, matches in WWE 2K17 have a distinctly measured pace, focused on capturing the look and feel of the current WWE product as closely as possible. It's an acquired taste, for sure, and if you haven't enjoyed this deliberate style previously--and perhaps yearn for the days of old--2K17 isn’t going to change your mind. With that being said, however, I wouldn't hesitate to call WWE 2K17 a better video game than its immediate predecessors. For one, singles matches have seen some incremental refinements that improve the ebb and flow of each contest. While the reversal system, pin/kickout mechanics, stamina management, and submission minigame remain relatively unchanged, there's some welcome fine-tuning sprinkled throughout. Counters, for instance, now feature a much more generous timing window and come in two flavors: minor and major--with the latter eating up two reversal slots but dishing out damage to your thwarted opponent. There's also an alternative submission minigame that ditches the swiveling red and blue blocks for much more intuitive button mashing. And taunting now provides mid-match buffs, which makes sense and gives these gestures the same measure of importance they carry on TV. For the first time in a few years, you can take the fight backstage, too. With the gorilla position, a hazardous hallway, locker room, and Authority office ready to be demolished, this isn't as gargantuan a space as it was in the halcyon days of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, but there's no denying the joy to be had powerbombing your opponent onto a sturdy oak desk while Vince McMahon stands by, undeterred. Sure, backstage brawls are nothing groundbreaking, but it's an anarchic addition that's entirely welcome. Similarly welcome are some of the improvements made to multi-person matches. Previously, these scuffles were a noxious mix of the chaotic and the frustrating. With everyone stuffed inside the ring at the same time, moves were constantly disrupted, and matches would extend far beyond their expiration date as one pin after another was irritatingly broken up. WWE 2K17 fixes this issue and injects a dose of realism into proceedings at the same time. Much like actual multi-person matches, the action is still mostly confined to two warring combatants. As damage is inflicted to various superstars, they'll roll out of the ring and lay on the outside to recover for a short time, making the in-ring action a lot less disorganised. Mechanically, this gives you time to regain lost stamina, but you can also cut this process short if you want to get up early and try to stop someone else from getting a three-count. Switching between targets is, thankfully, a lot less cumbersome this year, too. A simple tap of R3 cycles through each wrestler involved in the bout, with the name of your target appearing above your wrestler's head for a short moment. Ladder matches have also seen some ease-of-use adjustments. Now, you'll never have to suffer the ignominy of setting up a ladder--only to climb it and find out it's not in the exact right position required to grab a dangling briefcase. Ladder placement is now restricted to specific positions dotted around the arena, which certainly makes things easier but does rob these matches of some spontaneity. All of these changes, however incremental, move the needle in a positive direction. But some nagging issues still drag down the overall quality of the in-ring action. Now, I'm not expecting this series to suddenly adopt the fast-paced, arcade-style sensibilities of its forebears, but something slightly more sprightly wouldn’t be amiss, either. The pace of the action is still far too plodding, and the game is overly reliant on disconnected reversals dictating the outcome of each matchup. Maybe it's implausible, with such a bevy of moves available, to somehow coalesce the reversal system with the excellent motion-captured animation, but simply tapping a button when a prompt appears above your head feels far too rigid and detached from the action. These issues aren't game-breakers, and some will appreciate the deliberate pacing. But the series is still a long way off from being a king in the ring. Online matches are effected by the same latency problems that have plagued the series for years. The general flow of each fight is fine, but the timing window for reversals is impacted, so kicking out of pins becomes nigh on impossible. I was constantly defeated minutes into fights purely because the timing of counters gets knocked so far out of whack that it's incredibly difficult to react with the necessary precision. In most instances, it felt like my button presses weren't even registering. I wouldn't hesitate to call WWE 2K17 a better video game than its immediate predecessors. The lack of 2K Showcase mode this year puts a damper on the proceedings as well. By offering a guided tour through some of the most memorable moments in WWE history, 2K Showcase was a nostalgia-fuelled romp of recreating famous matches and being treated to WWE’s wonderfully reverential video packages. It’s absence this year can’t help but strip WWE 2K17 of much of its personality, and that leaves MyCareer to pick up the slack. Much like year’s previous, MyCareer is still an incredibly tedious slog, as you use a created fighter to wrestle your way through the roster, ever so slowly grinding your way closer and closer to a title fight. It’s bland and lacks character, neglecting all of the pomp, spectacle, and engaging storylines that encompass the actual WWE. This is an odd issue, considering how 2K’s own NBA series has embraced the idea of sporting narratives in MyCareer. Wrestling should be an obvious choice for similarly scripted stories, but WWE 2K17 is far more interested in presenting meaningless matches and monitoring T-shirt sales than in aping its real-life counterpart. Even the ability to become a Paul Heyman Guy boils down to fulfilling a few insipid objectives with minimal payoff. One interesting aspect of MyCareer is the introduction of interactive promos. These exist elsewhere in Universe mode, but they make much more sense as a tool to shape your own created character. The aim of promos is to essentially play up your heel or face persona in order to achieve a positive or negative reaction, depending on how ""smarky"" the crowd is on any given night. You have four options to choose from for each stage of the promo, but these choices are incredibly vague and rarely reflect what your character is actually going to say. This proves problematic when you’re trying to lean a certain way, especially if you want your promo to be the least bit cohesive. The writing here is also terrible for the most part, which can’t help but break the immersion when Bray Wyatt says ""You hate me because you ain’t me"" or Brock Lesnar complains about a bad smell backstage. With no voice acting to speak of--just superstars moving their mouths to abject silence--this mechanic feels like a first draft that still needs plenty of work. I appreciate the effort, because it's about time a wrestling video game tried to capture one of the industry's most important aspects, but the implementation is lacking. Other presentation issues persist throughout. The commentary is as atrocious as ever. It's stilted and regularly irrelevant--which some would argue is entirely true to life. Replays are universally awful, too, often showing pins rather than the moves that preceded them. And the whole game is considerably outdated. This isn't 2K's fault, mind you. At some point, the developers have to lock down their content and actually finish the game. They're just in the unenviable position of releasing a game a couple of months after a vast upheaval in the WWE, with the brand split resulting in a wave of NXT callups, new teams forming, shifting character alignments, new commentary teams, and new sets. Fortunately, if you're a stickler for accuracy, WWE 2K17's exhaustive creation suite means that many of these issues can easily be rectified, with the community already creating plenty of near-perfect new attires, wrestlers, and set designs. No matter how you spruce it up, however, WWE 2K17 isn't the substantial leap forward I was hoping for. The in-ring action is still serviceable, and refinements to various aspects of its combat make for a more enjoyable game than in previous years. But there are still a myriad of niggling issues holding it back, and the absence of 2K Showcase only compounds these problems. If you’ve had previous reservations about this series, WWE 2K17 is unlikely to change your mind--and, at this point, it feels like 2K would be better served taking a page out of Seth Rollins' book for next year’s installment. Time to redesign, rebuild, and reclaim.  ","Developed collaboratively by Yuke’s and Visual Concepts, a 2K studio, WWE 2K17 is scheduled for worldwide release on October 11, 2016.",5.2
133,Justin Clark,,5,The Silver Case,"Oct 6, 2016"," If Suda 51 represents one of a scant few auteur game designers, The Silver Case, finally released on Western shores in this remastered form, is basically his student film, a statement of intent and trajectory rather than its own cohesive masterwork. As such, The Silver Case has a few of the elements that fans have come to recognize in a legitimate ""Suda 51 Joint"", but those elements are obscured by convoluted point-and-click gameplay, and a story that meanders, rants, and rambles getting where it needs to go. The overarching narrative involves the return of an infamous serial killer named Kamui Uehara to a futuristic Japanese city known as the 24 Wards--and the efforts of a small investigative team to take him down. The game features two scenarios: In the first, Transmitter, you play as a mute detective who is somehow spared by the killer Kamui on the night he first reappears. In the other scenario, Placebo, you take on the role of a freelance reporter whose tale runs parallel to the first mode, as you sort through the mess after the cops are done. The Silver Case's gameplay uses bog-standard adventure game mechanics. You can walk around your environment from one specified point to another by just turning, looking, and pushing up on the keyboard/gamepad. Once at a specific point, noted with a technicolor star indicator, you can use the Check option to get more details or activate the next scene. Some moments and puzzles require special tools in the Implements menu, but these moments are rare. For the most part, you're basically just following the dialogue around a room to get to the next scene. It's always when it's least expected or necessary that the game finally cottons to the fact that you might want to play it, and then it has the player knocking on doors, asking witnesses questions, wandering aimlessly around an environment to find the trigger for the next scene, or, in some cases, solving tricky little ciphers to open a door. Still, you can go long stretches without ever getting a button tap in. Some scenes literally have the protagonist walk two steps ahead, then trigger a long dialogue that may not let up for 10 minutes. The game is framed like episodes of a television show, with each taking maybe an hour and a half to two hours to complete each--assuming you don't get tripped up by an obtuse puzzle or have to re-check every door and contact point looking for the one action prompt you missed; or assuming you don’t get confused by the controls altogether, where just getting to the point of moving forward through the first-person space is a three-step process instead of just pressing forward. The same goes for looking up, down, investigating an object, or talking to someone in the room, all which involve an overly convoluted, clunky menu. Even if you gain some sort of finesse with the controls, the game's length remains a sticking point due to some terrible pacing and difficulty parsing new story details. Bad controls in a '90s point-and-click adventure can be tolerated if the stories are well paced and brilliantly executed, but each Silver Case episode is padded with filler. Every detective seems to have a philosophical ramble on every small decision they have to make in the field, and none of these characters are interesting or layered enough to make this stuff compelling. Most fall into the category of thinking that their job is dumb, and anybody putting in effort is a loser. This, of course, is one of the hallmarks of Suda 51's work: apathetic heroes treating a completely insane, terrifying scenario as a nuisance keeping them from a good nap. The main issue with The Silver Case, however, is that--some bizarre minor details aside--the scenarios here are grounded in reality more than anything Suda made afterward. The usual fuzzy logic and unnatural human interactions that add to the “playable dreamscape” feeling of most of his games is an ill fit here. These are plausible scenarios, worked on by implausible characters. When the game does get to the business of actually presenting the gory details of each case, it fares better. The overarching narrative of the Kamui case is the glowing red seed of abstract madness that has come to define Suda's work, and the horrors presented whenever the plot progresses are chilling and effective. Some of the other scenarios, including a hilariously dated (yet sadly, still prescient) case based around cyberbullying are just dead-weight slogs to get through. Others, however, such as a case that revolves around a man held for ransom while his businesses are completely dismantled by a mute terrorist, are breezy and captivating-- that one employs a beautiful black-and-white noir-ish art style. The Placebo scenario as a whole gets some points for having an active, talkative, interesting protagonist to tag along with. Even the good cases are sometimes hard to get a solid grasp on, however, and the fact that so many different art styles--CG, anime, live action, still manga panels--are employed willy-nilly to tell the tales doesn't help. While some of the varieties in art direction are compelling, there are often too many to get a firm grasp on what the game aims for as a whole. For this remaster, Suda enlisted his longtime collaborator Akira Yamaoka to help remix the score, and while the music by itself is a fun, jazzy throwback most of the time, it, too, flies in the face of whatever of import is happening onscreen. More than anything, The Silver Case is more interesting in the context of Suda 51's career than it is as a standalone game. It shows an ambitious floating of new ideas past the player, and much of how the story is presented would later find a more welcome home when surrounded by much weirder, wilder worlds. Stranded in the framework of a police procedural, however, the game fails its best concepts. The Silver Case's unusual take on human conversations, its indecision about whether it wants to be just a visual novel or an adventure game where the player is a full participant, and its lack of focus in tying up any sort of cohesive plot, all add up to a mess of a game.

134,Justin Clark,Everyone 10+,5,100ft Robot Golf,"Oct 10, 2016"," It's a rare thing in this day and age when everything you need to know about a game is right there in the title--and even rarer that said title is such an instantly appealing concept like 100-foot robots playing golf. And yet, even if 100ft Robot Golf is an inspired concept, the actual game is anything but. That's an unfortunate thing, too, because everything that isn't gameplay overflows with charm and quirky, self-aware personality. It all starts with the game's overarching presentation: 100ft Robot Golf is presented as if it's the crappy American dub of a mid-'90s anime (complete with Dragon Ball Z-inspired cutscenes with fake watermarks that note the shady torrent site from which it was downloaded) about a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has just finished crawling back from the brink, building massive biodomes and skyscrapers to house their remnants. Golf, the gentleman's sport of the age, is now played entirely by massive mechs, driven by all manner of eccentrics--pudgy car salesmen, hijab-clad skateboarding teenagers, and five corgis driving five dog-shaped mechs who come together to form one giant mech, Power Rangers-style. A Corgizord, if you will. The cutscenes give some context for why and how these folks get roped into the golf tournament, which veer into such goofy non sequiturs that it's almost worth the asking price of the game just to watch these folks interact. Thing is, the only scrap of that bonkers setup that makes its way into the actual golf portion of the game comes from the running commentary of the McElroy brothers (of My Brother, My Brother And Me podcast and Adventure Zone fame). Their commentary ranges from the knowingly cheesy--bad golf puns about Ryan Gosling in Drive and Smash Mouth's All Star, for instance--to the darkly hilarious. One particular line about Kermit the Frog not surviving the apocalypse is probably the deepest, most guilty gut laugh I've ever gotten from a game. The full-on breakdown over the aforementioned corgi mech joining the tournament is the most I've laughed at a game that doesn’t include Saints Row in the title. Aside from the commentary, however, the game itself is fairly basic. The fundamentals are easy enough to pick up: You walk to the ball, hit X, choose one of your three clubs, use the left stick to adjust your shot, and swing away. Given that you're playing as a giant robot, you'll tromp through courses derived from crowded cities, desolate mountain villages, and underwater wastelands. If you want to be a jerk, you can use your body to block your opponent's shot or knock down buildings and bridges with your club. Your robots have special abilities, too. Pressing L1 might fire a barrage of laser fire or missiles, unleash a giant sword instead of a club, or let your mech skateboard to their next shot in style. Robots can also occasionally unleash a special effect on the ball to gain an edge, such as making the ball bouncier to go further than where it was aimed, or turning it into a bomb that can destroy obstacles in its path. That's more exciting in writing than in practice, however. Aside from the admittedly well-designed mechs, the graphics are rudimentary blocky polygons, and destroying buildings doesn't reduce them to smoldering rubble so much as it breaks them apart like giant Lego pieces that scatter around and then disappear over time. People and cars are in your path in the city, but they don't react to the robots laying waste their surroundings. Yes, you have special abilities, but the game has nothing in the way of a tutorial, so virtually everything is trial-and-error. But even when you do learn how to use these abilities, the vast majority are entirely unnecessary thanks to the poor abilities of your opponents. The AI in the single-player campaign is almost medically fascinating in its ineptitude, with more than one match won in my playthroughs because the AI opponent kept deliberately driving their ball into the ocean. Matches against humans are, of course, trickier, but none of the extra abilities are game-changers. It's simply more enjoyable to play the game as a straight up mini golf title with your friends than it is trying to futz around with ineffective and poorly implemented superpowers. The best idea in the game involves a twist on the traditional video game golf swing mechanic: Each mech is designed so that charging up your swing is a completely different little minigame with each character, making your choice of mech a much more personalized affair than the minutiae of overly technical PGA titles. There's also PlayStation VR support that places your point of view in the cockpit of your mech. This gives the game an extra sense of scale, but even that feels like a slapdash affair, often obscuring your view below. What’s more, it makes some tasks--such as changing your club or seeing the arc of your ball before swinging--difficult, if not impossible. Coincidentally, much of the game's voice cast is plucked from the Youtube comedy/gaming community, which seems oddly self-fulfilling, since the game is likely to be more enjoyable watching other people comment and play rather than actually playing it. 100t Robot Golf is an elaborate, even hilarious, joke, that rather perfunctorily has a game attached to it.

135,Mike Mahardy,Mature,9,Titanfall 2,"Oct 28, 2016"," Titanfall 2 is a game about momentum. It knows when to rush forward at a breakneck pace. It knows when to give us time to breathe. Both in its single player campaign and its multiplayer modes, Titanfall 2 has a more measured pace than its predecessor, making the build-up to its climactic battles just as enticing as the events themselves. It's every bit as kinetic and fluid as the first Titanfall--but in many respects, it's a much better shooter. As with the first game from Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall 2 revolves around two layers of combat: conventional firefights between human combatants, and clashes between massive bipedal mechs. As a boots-on-the-ground pilot, Titanfall 2 feels more like a traditional shooter--albeit one with pristine controls and a fluid traversal system. The first Titanfall sparked the trend of shooters focused on movement, and with its sequel, the series reestablishes its place at the head of the pack. The loop of sliding, double jumping, vaulting a ledge, and running along a wall to flank an enemy feels invigorating and intuitive. Then it comes time to call in your mechanical ally from orbit, and everything changes when it hits the ground. Because it's when these two layers engage in a tug-of-war that Titanfall 2 reveals its true brilliance. What was once an even fight becomes a David versus Goliath scenario: a pilot rushes to cover, fires off a rocket, glides along a nearby wall, avoids a missile salvo from her robotic opponent, activates her cloaking device, and enters a nearby ravine to order a Titan of her own. This sequence is intense, but in Titanfall 2, it's commonplace. Momentum often shifts as one team gains control of the battlefield, only to lose ground when the other notices a weak spot, and attacks it. This is crucial in Titanfall 2. Now more than ever, combat requires forethought and intelligence. Humans may be careening across the map with grapple hooks, while phase-warping ninja mechs cut through laser-powered robot warriors--but beneath all of this is a hidden nuance. Despite the bombast and spectacle, Titanfall 2 is a thinking person's shooter. The sequel's new Titans embody this sentiment. In place of the basic light, medium, and heavy variants from the first game, Titanfall 2 employs six distinct walking battle tanks with arsenals of their own. They're almost like superheroes: one attacks with a thermite launcher and flame attacks, while another fires a chest-mounted laser cannon at unlucky opponents. Each of the Titans' abilities are easy to learn, but difficult to master, as the saying goes. Their loadouts immediately make sense, and it's easy to see that Northstar's low armor and long-range railgun make her an ideal sniper--but new layers reveal themselves the more you play. Take Scorch, for example. His flame shield dissolves incoming projectiles, providing extra protection while he tries to back away from close-quarter engagements. But the flame shield has other uses: at one point, an enemy pilot came flying at me on a grappling hook. By igniting my fiery barrier, I melted him just as he came close to my cockpit. There are elements of fighting games or MOBAs here--each Titan has a tell, and a way to counter it. Learning the intricacies of each Titan is paramount not just for offense, but defense, too. Each mech has a distinct aesthetic, so as you round a corner and see a Ronin approaching you, you know to put distance between your Titan and the shotgun-toting enemy. There are elements of fighting games or MOBAs here--each Titan has a tell, and you only have a few brief moments to counter it to your advantage. The new Titans lend a very different pace to multiplayer matches. While the first Titanfall was always turned up to 11, so to speak, with smaller maps and cookie-cutter Titans focused on dealing damage, Titanfall 2 understands the value of breathing room. It doesn't burn you out with an onslaught of firefights--its maps are focused on exterior environments, and are often on the larger side, giving you time to plan out your attack with the intricate Titan loadouts. The plan may go awry, but it lends more weight to each enemy encounter. There's a sense of build-up as you approach a capture point, knowing full well which Titans occupy the area, and thinking through each step in your head. Each multiplayer mode is tailored to facilitate Titanfall 2's interwoven combat systems, but also to twist the formula in creative ways. Bounty Hunt is my favorite--you gain currency by killing the enemy team and AI grunts that litter the map, and at the end of each wave, you're given the option to deposit your loot in one of several banks. But here's the wrinkle: you have to leave your Titan in order to do so. What's more, clever players will camp near banks to pick off unsuspecting Pilots as they approach their goal. It's a frantic game of cat and mouse that increases in tension as the banks open and each team knows exactly what the other is doing, or trying to do. Then there's Last Titan Standing, a match that ends when the last mech is destroyed. It's the most methodical mode, as team members assess the enemy team composition and approach firefights carefully, considering there are no respawns. Pilot vs. Pilot eschews the titular robots, opting instead to focus on the fluid human against human combat--but even without its hulking behemoths, Titanfall 2 is frantic and exhilarating. That expert attention to pacing and momentum carries over into Titanfall 2's single-player mode as well. While the first Titanfall consigned its story to a specific story driven multiplayer playlist, the sequel places you in a discrete campaign with its own plot, characters, and set pieces. It follows Jack Cooper, a Militia rifleman-turned-pilot, and his sentient Titan BT-7274, as they battle the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation and the Apex Predator mercenary group. Unfortunately, the writing here is lacking. Your main enemies are outlandish villains, and the plot ends abruptly, before it feels like it should. And while there is often humor and sentiment to be found between Cooper and BT, the jokes become rote when they focus too much on the Titan's inability to understand human sayings and turns of phrase. There are moments where I felt a real connection to my Titan, and there is heart to be found throughout this story. But those moments are few and far between The single-player campaign gradually increases in velocity and scope, coalescing in mid-air ship battles and frantic Titan charges. Yet in terms of design and pacing, the five-hour campaign is fantastic. It begins with a botched mission on the planet Typhon, and although it takes a little too much time to do anything out of the ordinary, the missions then increase in velocity and scope, coalescing in mid-air ship battles, frantic Titan charges, and old-school boss fights. These boss fights pit you against the other Titan variants, and as you progress through the missions, you'll unlock all of Titanfall 2's Titan loadouts, gaining the ability to swap between them on the fly. This grants the campaign a dynamism not entirely present in multiplayer. You can enter a battlefield, discern the situation, and choose a different Titan based on the scenario, all in the span of several seconds. Coupled with the quality of Titanfall 2's missions--my favorite plays with time in a way I won't spoil here--the ability to change Titans on the fly gives the campaign a pacing of its own. Titanfall 2 accomplishes several things. It introduces seemingly minor changes to its multiplayer sphere, but results in more fluid pacing and an intelligent gameplay loop. It adds a single-player campaign that builds in momentum with each mission, culminating in a grandiose battles that makes use of both Pilot and Titan combat. And lastly, Titanfall 2 demonstrates a vitality that its predecessor couldn't. Whereas the first Titanfall kept up its breakneck pace throughout the entirety of every match, Titanfall 2 understands that sometimes, dialing things back for a few moments can make the long run much more enjoyable. In many ways, Titanfall 2 feels like the game Respawn should have made in 2013. It's a fantastic sequel. It's a fluid shooter. It's a spectacular game.

136,Scott Butterworth,Everyone 10+,9,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"Oct 20, 2016"," The original Civilization came out in 1991. I was five years old at the time. I didn't fully grasp the game's historical underpinnings or strategic subtleties, but I do remember playing with my dad and racing to build catapults before other leaders had a chance to expand their empires too far. Because even though the first game laid the groundwork not just for future Civ titles but for the strategy genre as a whole, it was, essentially, a glorified arms race. Yes, you could found cities, build world wonders, and unlock new options through technological research, but inevitably, combat played a central role. Just like a real civilization, however, the franchise evolved over time, gradually grafting new ideas onto its classic framework--a process that’s now culminated in Civilization VI: the deepest, most well-rounded base game the series has ever seen. More than ever, every win condition feels equally rich and equally viable, whether you’re pursuing culture, religion, science, or domination. You can build arts districts that allow you to more quickly accrue culture points and attract great artists. You can create new religious units like apostles to more efficiently spread your gospel to world. You can use the builder unit in new ways to better capitalize on the resources that surround your cities, accelerating humanity’s ascent into space. And of course, you can still amass a formidable army, but even warfare presents new considerations that force you to lean on other systems beyond battle tactics. Maintaining military units, for example, is expensive, but picking trade routes with a high gold yield helps mitigate the financial impact. War weariness will eventually lead your population to revolt, but using diplomacy to squeeze luxury resources out of your allies can quell rebellion. And espionage, now deeper than ever, lets you not only place spies but pick specific missions for them to carry out. Civ 6 is packed with added nuances that enrich existing systems, but it also makes some major changes, the biggest of which is “unstacking” cities. Rather than occupy a single tile on the world map, cities now sprawl outward, allowing you to capitalize on each city’s specific surroundings--assuming you exercise some serious foresight. Certain structures, for example, function more efficiently on specific types of land, while others can only be built if certain typographical demands are met. Not only does this change the way you consider the board, it also adds a new strategic layer that fills a gap and creates greater variety in the types of thinking Civ demands. Along with planning each city’s long-term development, you must also manage its housing and amenity needs. These replace the global food and happiness levels of previous Civilizations and make individual turns more engaging in the process. Where previously you could mentally check out for a few turns while waiting for your big picture decisions to pan out, you must now actively monitor and improve each city’s condition. It can be a little exasperating and tedious, but ultimately, I realized each and every city contributed to my overall success and, consequently, provided unique opportunities for strategic gain. You’ll find a host of slightly smaller but equally smart changes as well. You can now tailor your government to your specific playstyle by earning various policy cards that impact everything from war weariness to cultural output. Civics replace social policies and now function identically to technologies: pick one from an expansive tree, spend a few turns researching it, and unlock new cultural possibilities like theocracy or globalization. And with the addition of active research, you can cut research time in half by meeting specific, logical conditions tied to individual Techs and Civics--settling next to a coast will boost your research in sailing, for instance. This practice ensures an advantage for vigilant players. Smart though these changes may be, they are accompanied by several notable imperfections. Tourism, for example, is the metric by which Cultural Victories are measured, yet the math behind it is esoteric at best. Missionaries and other religious units are similarly opaque. Though I did manage a Cultural Victory during one match, it required some frustrating trial-and-error guesswork, and Religious Victories seem slightly too easy to achieve once you uncover the ideal method for maximizing your output. And while you could argue that commerce and diplomacy facilitate every win condition, it’s a shame neither serves as a win condition itself. The UI could also use a few refinements. There's absolutely no rhyme or reason to ""Unit needs orders"" notification, for example. Rather than directing your attention to units already on screen, it arbitrarily whips around the map, seeming highlighting units at random. I experienced a few performance hitches as well, like noticable delays between selecting the Civics menu and the menu actually appearing on screen. Nothing I experienced ever became intolerable, thankfully; my frustrations generally topped out at ""annoyed."" And other aspects of the presentation--most notably the instrumental score and Sean Bean's excellent voice work--definitely won me over. Perhaps most crucially, though, opponent AI proved to be a bit of a mix. Catherine Medici was clever enough to preemptively declare war against me when she saw my troops massing at her border, and even brought anti-cavalry units to take down my tanks. Cleopatra, on the other hand, seemed to capriciously switch strategies--from religion to domination and back again--and just floundered uselessly as a result. If nothing else, the new agenda system does imbue each leader with a discernable playstyle, and when one denounced me, the game explicitly told me why, making diplomacy a more straightforward affair. And even on higher difficulties, none of opponents broke a treaty or attacked me arbitrarily. In fact, I spent an entire match trading with Norway without issue. Of course, you can avoid the AI altogether by playing online--just one of Civ 6’s many options. There’s a tight, well-executed tutorial for newcomers that briskly runs through the game’s major mechanics, as well as a “New to Civ 6” tips option that focuses specifically on everything that's changed since Civ 5, which should soften the learning curve for veterans looking to jump straight into the deep end. There's a lot to account for, but the fact that every new system slots logically into Civ's established structure makes the game relatively accessible despite of its depth. Adjustable match parameters return as well, allowing you to adjust not only the difficulty but also the number of opponents, the presence of barbarians, and the overall map size. That last one is especially crucial since the ""standard"" size has decreased, most likely to force more interaction. Playing on larger maps with fewer opponents seems to work just fine, though. International trade takes longer and territorial expansion is far easier, but the game still plays largely the same. Civ 6 has a few rough edges, but they’re pushed far into the periphery by spectacular strategic depth and intricate interlocking nuances. Any frustrations I experienced were immediately eclipsed by my desire to continue playing. Just one more turn, every turn, forever.",Sid Meier’s Civilization VI is a turn-based strategy game in which you attempt to build an empire to stand the test of time.,8
137,Heidi Kemps,Everyone 10+,6,World of Final Fantasy,"Oct 25, 2016"," World of Final Fantasy feels like a game that celebrates the series’ massive legacy while also making it friendlier to a younger audience. Unfortunately, it stumbles in a few key places, making it more of an awkward mixer than the all-encompassing RPG party players might be anticipating. Things don't exactly get off to a rollicking start. After a cryptic initial cutscene, you’re treated to a too-long set of introductory cinematics that offer little in the way of actual introduction. You meet fraternal twins Lann and Reynn, who apparently have been living a normal life in a city working at a coffee shop--until a mysterious woman and a strange creature give them surprising news. The twins learn that they--and their mother--were once important figures in a world named Grymoire filled with monsters and tiny people known as Lilikin. It’s a pretty head-scratching introduction--and not in a good way. It doesn’t help that Enna vanishes while calling herself “god.” The duo are left with Tama as their guide, who has a speech the-pattern that will very quickly start to drive you the-bonkers. When the twins get to Grymoire, they discover they can change from tiny to normal size to get around and interact with the populace. They also can “imprism” the Mirage monsters that roam Grymoire, turning them into battling companions. Bad things are afoot in Grymoire, however--a group of armor-clad figures called the Bahamutian Army have annexed numerous territories in the realm under the guise of benevolence, though their true goal is to enact a complex prophecy involving plenty of good old fashioned chaos and destruction. Grymoire is a beautiful place filled with otherworldly environments that, combined with the cute monsters that lurk within, capture a whimsical, storybook feel. When they’re not traversing the wilderness, Lann and Reynn wind up in towns based on locations from previous Final Fantasy games, such as Nibelheim from Final Fantasy VII. It’s here that the duo will usually encounter familiar (but cuter) Final Fantasy characters who harbor the souls of “champions” and use their abilities to help Lann and Reynn defeat the Bahamutian Army’s evil machinations. Despite its chibi-sized Final Fantasy heroes and focus on monster collecting, you won't be summoning an army of adorable Final Fantasy characters to do battle for you. Most of your battling companions are of the monstrous variety--you can only summon famous Final Fantasy characters to battle after dealing and accruing enough damage, and only after meeting them in the story and acquiring their Champion Medal. They don’t show up for long--they just unleash a special attack and then peace out, acting much like summoned monsters would in a traditional Final Fantasy game. Despite its chibi-sized Final Fantasy heroes and focus on monster collecting, you won't be summoning an army of adorable Final Fantasy characters to do battle for you. That isn’t to say that combat is a completely by-the-numbers affair. Lann and Reynn can have up to four monsters accompany them in fights. Every monster is assigned a size--small, medium, or large--and you can “stack” the twins and monsters into a cute critter column to fight with. Stacks offer a lot of benefits: characters in a stack pool their health, ability points, attack and defense power, skills, and elemental resistances together to create a powerful entity that can withstand heavy hits and deal more damage than the characters would individually--at the cost of the turns each individual character would get in battle. Characters in a stack can also combine certain skills and turn them into more powerful techniques. For example, if two stacked characters have water magic, you’ll get access to a higher-level water spell. Enemies can also stack up for similar benefits, so sometimes you’ll want to use attacks that can topple a stack of characters. When a stack collapses, everyone in the tower winds up stunned for a turn, giving you free rein to smack them around. Naturally, your towers are just as vulnerable to collapsing, so you need to be careful when you see signs of wobbling. Of course, before you can stack up critters like a pile of pancakes, you’ll need to capture them. While many monsters become catchable after a few simple attacks, others require very specific actions before you can imprism them: You may have to hit them with a particular status ailment, give them an item, or use a particular style of attack. While this helps make the game’s monster-catching element a bit more dynamic, it can be extremely annoying in practice. You may run into some one-time-encounter monster in the field, only to discover that you don't have the skills in your current party necessary to capture them. You can't run from these fights, nor can you swap out monsters in battle, leaving you no choice but to beat the rare monster normally and cry over the missed opportunity. That’s only one of a pile of little annoyances that drag down the World of Final Fantasy experience. The battles, even at max speed, move at a glacial pace, making it almost necessary to hold R1 to fast forward through them at all times (and tiring your index finger in the process). Every monster has a “Mirage Board” similar to the Sphere Grid and Crystarium from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XIII, respectively; these unlock various skills and abilities by using points earned from leveling up. These kinds of skill-up grids work nicely in role-playing games with limited character sets, but they become a royal pain to manage when you’re juggling numerous creatures in and out of your party. Most monsters in the game have alternate forms that you can access when they reach a certain level, but these variations don’t retain many of the skills of their previous incarnations, and the new forms have their own Mirage Boards to futz around with. The overarching story, exploration, and monster collecting didn’t interest me nearly as much as seeing which Final Fantasy character I might encounter next. Dungeons tend to be very linear (and they’re less fun to explore than they are to look at), and you’ll sometimes come to a puzzle or obstacle that requires a specific monster skill or set of properties in order to progress. If you don’t have the right monsters in your current party you must either use an expensive item or go back to a teleport/save point to swap in the correct monsters or capture some new beasts with the properties you need (and perhaps grind them up to unlock the necessary skill to progress). At least there’s some reward for suffering through these aggravations: The dialogue and character writing are both incredibly charming, filled with lots of peppy exchanges between the twins and the assorted NPCs they encounter (the aforementioned Tama excepted). A little bit into the game, you get the ability to participate in various character vignettes starring the Final Fantasy characters.These segments are ridiculously adorable and tons of fun to watch. The further I advanced in World of Final Fantasy, the more it felt like I was just playing to see the little interactions among the twins and the other characters--the overarching story, exploration, and monster collecting didn’t interest me nearly as much as seeing which Final Fantasy character I might encounter next. The game is ultimately worse when it stops being cute and goofy and tries to tell a serious story. Unfortunately, you have to put up with a fair amount of frustration and filler before you get to enjoy the best of what World of Final Fantasy has to offer, namely charming writing and Final Fantasy fan service. If you’re willing to put up with some of the game’s mundane sequences, you’ll get some enjoyment out of it, but if you’re not a Final Fantasy fanatic, the magic in these moments may be lost altogether.  ","World of Final Fantasy combines classic RPG gameplay mechanics with a fresh and imaginative toy-like visuals. As a brand-new title in the FINAL FANTASY franchise, this game can be enjoyed by both fans and newcomers to the series. Players will lead a pair of twins through varied FINAL FANTASY worlds and encounter the adorably familiar monsters therein. Capture and raise such familiar beasts as cactuar, tonberry, and behemoth to discover alternate forms and learn new abilities.",8.7
138,Daniel Starkey,,8,BUTCHER,"Oct 5, 2016"," Saturated with the blood of dozens of hapless souls, the floors squish beneath my feet. But there's plenty more work to be done. Chainsaw-wielding, rocket-powered cyborg mega-men attack from all directions as I struggle to dip and dodge between their mechanical blades. With each successful shotgun blast, another bursts into pixelated flames and lo-fi screams. Butcher isn't for the faint of heart, and I don't just mean because, as its tagline says, ""the easiest mode is Hard."" It's raucous and aggressive, channeling the same violent and brutal '90s counterculture that birthed Doom and Duke Nukem. This time around, the chaos and gore of those hyper-masculine, guns-and-balls shooters comes in the form of a 2D action-platformer. Its pixelated ultraviolence is accentuated by appropriately abrasive sound design--clanks and grinds harmonize with the vibrations of heavy machinery in a way that feels strangely timed to your play--no matter how quickly you rip and tear. Most enemies can shoot and kill you as long as they can see you--even if you're clear across the screen. And because each area has dozens of trigger-happy bad guys ready to splatter your insides all over the walls, controlling visibility with corners and other obstacles is essential. As you go, you learn how important it is to limit your vulnerability. You'd think this would turn the game into a stealthy romp, but that's not quite accurate. Butcher builds up to a ludicrous pace and encourages exploration to find the best tactic to handle any given conflict. There's an emphasis maneuvering between different elevations. Strangely, however, that doesn't affect line of sight--both you and the meatbags you need to shred can shoot through most floors and ceilings. This means that you'll often need to peek your head out to catch their attention, then quickly move to a position where you can lie waiting in ambush. This works, for the most part, because so many of the environments support that style of play. If you're clever, you can kick (or trick) enemies into pits of lava and other hazards.   Butcher builds up to a ludicrous pace and encourages exploration to find the best tactic to handle any given conflict. This process gets tougher as the game goes on. Enemies will start pulling out quick-firing rocket launchers, and as they swarm you in great numbers, you'll have to tighten up your marksmanship and move faster to avoid incoming projectiles. If you miss a few too many shots, you'll run out of ammo and have to rely on your chainsaw to finish the job. This, of course, requires you to get much, much closer to your victims, leaving you exposed. Butcher always offers a trade-off between expediency and safety. That trade-off is essential, adding a bit of depth and pushing you to change your approach as you grow more and more confident in your skills. Outside of combat, Butcher bleeds style. Each stage is an industrial or post-apocalyptic hellscape, complete with booming metal, lava, and grimdark backgrounds draped with chains and bones. The game leans on its presentation to help sell the theme of anarchic, bloody combat. Each gunshot visibly shakes the screen, and successive hits yield torrents of blood. Kills often generate pixelated chunks of nondescript body parts that you can kick around the stage--either to coat the area in blood or into an enemy as a distraction. Butcher is a living relic, a callback to the days when being gritty and macabre was a goal unto itself. But make no mistake: beneath that gruff exterior is a thoughtfully crafted game . The allure of an ultraviolent indulgence might be enough to get some in the door, but the visuals are so pixelated and the audio so compressed that Butcher never feels excessive. More than anything, the aesthetic is backdrop for a remarkably creative game that coaxes you to try new, risky strategies in search of a higher score.  ",,7.8
139,Miguel Concepcion,Mature,7,Dark Souls III,"Apr 12, 2016"," Ashes of Ariandel, the first of two announced content add-ons for Dark Souls III, excels at feeling like a natural extension of the main game. It delivers much of what veterans expect from Dark Souls: challenging bosses, a locale that promotes exploration, and a new collection of gear. What's missing is that sense of awe that usually pulls you deep into the series' dark fantasy worlds. Dark Souls' best regions are those that command your attention beyond the promise of a fabled weapon or a novel group of enemies to vanquish. Ashes of Ariandel isn't in the same class as Artorias of the Abyss – the standout, lore-rich add-on from the original Dark Souls – but that doesn't make it a poor expansion--it’s just not a noteworthy one. Like the frosted regions of Dark Souls II’s Crown of the Ivory King DLC, the Painted World of Ariandel is a wintry landscape that sometimes obscures its dangers behind fog and falling snow. Other areas provide typical Dark Souls vistas: The dramatic reveal of a grand chapel in the distance is enhanced by the foreground view of a long, fragile rope bridge. Like a similar overpass in the main game, this rickety span offers an access point to a new area, provided you have the imagination to find another purpose for the ropes. The Painted World of Ariandel is a little bit larger than any individual DLC episode from Dark Souls II, though the generous scattering of bonfires--the series' safe havens--shortens an otherwise long journey. Many areas are as vast as they are tall. The trudge up a steep hill is a fruitful exercise in amassing a large kill count as you also manage your health-replenishing Estus Flasks. The undead soldiers who populate this hill are no zombies--they move with purpose once they see you and tactfully strike as well as any imposing Dark Souls foe. There aren't just secrets in Ashes of Ariandel but also rewards for thorough exploration. One such prize is a switch that grants you access to the main boss, and the challenge comes from enduring the vile surroundings where the switch is found: a dark, dank room filled with giant flies that aim to kill you with bleed attacks. Dark Souls III: Ashes of Ariandel accentuates the value of the journey over the destination. Another reason to search every corner? To find the ticket to gain access to the PVP arena. While this online battleground is limited to one area designed especially for PVP, its replay value is reinforced by myriad match customization features, such as setting team sizes and access to consumables. While it's not engrossing enough to serve as the DLC's main draw, the ability to play beyond one-on-one battles is a welcome twist to a fan-favorite feature. Like many Dark Souls environments before it, Ashes of Ariandel accentuates the value of the journey over the destination. It's about collecting new sets of gear and vanquishing the armed, aggressive hostiles who linger around the goodies. Typical of many Dark Souls areas, some items aren't directly accessible upon first sight. Studying the lay of the land in order to reach those items is its own gratifying brain teaser. And in classic Dark Souls fashion, a shortcut is the reward for surviving an excursion to the unlockable side of an otherwise locked gate. Ashes of Ariandel's showcase battle is against Sister Friede, whose persona as a scythe-wielding nun--a holy death dealer, if you will--is an amusingly ham-fisted image. It’s a duel that becomes all the more memorable if it evolves into a battle of attrition, although expert players can avoid such a grind. Her magic-enhanced moveset doesn't include any surprises, though her speed and expansive repertoire make her a formidable opponent for those with average skills. Success against her requires defense and patience above all else, so players who lean on the aggressive side are doubly tested. She's also a superb reminder that this series still has the ability to teach veteran players new tactics--even those who already have dozens of boss kills under their belts. The rewards for defeating Friede--a pair of frost-enhanced scythes and a curious bouquet of roses designed for flagellation--are appropriately representative of the DLC’s other unique gear. The Millwood armor set is one of the few ensembles in this DLC that makes you look like Viking, while the Valorheart grants the user a new way to shield bash. A melee weapon like the Crow Talons doesn't have much value as a main weapon over the long haul but there is gratification to having this loot as trophies for triumphing over tougher foes. What Ashes of Ariandel lacks in originality, it makes up for in cohesion with the full version of Dark Souls III. The duel against Sister Friede, the DLC's highpoint, is the type of Dark Souls boss fight that makes an indelible impression--she’s on the same level as the Abyss Watchers or Dancer of the Boreal Valley. While Ashes of Ariandel is ultimately a safe addition to Dark Souls III, it's convincingly satisfying; the risk of death at any moment is as likely as finding a new piece of practical gear or the discovery of an unexplored path. Just don't expect any areas as memorable as those in the main game or revelatory moments that substantially expands the lore.  ",Dark Souls III is the latest chapter in the critically acclaimed Dark Souls series with its trademark sword and sorcery combat and rewarding action RPG gameplay.,8.4
140,Justin Clark,Everyone 10+,5,Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas,"Nov 14, 2013"," If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas is developer Cornfox & Bros building a candlelit shrine to The Legend of Zelda series. A more appropriate subtitle for it would be, “The names have been changed to protect the innocent.” It'd be one thing if Oceanhorn achieved a similar level of greatness as its inspirations or riffed on Zelda's core concepts in a meaningful way. But mostly, Oceanhorn's greatest achievement lies in accentuating the brilliance of those inspirations, rather than taking them to exciting, uncharted territory. Oceanhorn begins strongly enough. Our protagonist's father writes a final letter to his sleeping son before he goes off to face an eldritch beast of the deep, the titular Oceanhorn. When our hero awakes, he meets up with the local hermit for a quick lore lesson, then sets out on a top-down-perspective adventure across a series of scattered tropical islands to find his father--and maybe take down big bad Oceanhorn himself. Right from the start, Oceanhorn is simple and intuitive. It's nostalgic and refreshing to set out on a hero's journey, and the only two things you need to know for a stretch are that the analog stick moves you, one button attacks, and one button allows you to move objects. Targeting happens automatically, and you rarely deal with more than one enemy at a time--and 90 percent of that time, flailing wildly with the basic sword is enough. This feels like a blessed side effect of Oceanhorn being ported from mobile--the original having released on iOS in 2013. Such accessibility is appreciated, but modest aims elsewhere prove to be an issue. Most of Oceanhorn's puzzles are either of the rudimentary, block-moving sort or involve walking around long enough to find the key to the next room. Strangely, when a puzzle deviates from the norm, it often requires an illogical solution, like pushing a box through another physical object. The simple dungeons you explore are padded out by leading you to a certain point only to learn that you must look for an item elsewhere--which just so happens to be located on a whole other island, requiring a frustrating amount of backtracking. Disappointment sets in once you realize that all of this effort leads to little payoff. The story doesn't take any major twists and turns, and NPC characters are stock townsfolk who exist purely for the sake of exposition. Journeys between towns and islands are taken by sailboat, a nod to The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. But Oceanhorn's seafaring is even more sparse and uneventful than exploring a village. Voyages transpire automatically once you point your ship toward an island, but sailing on rails robs you of completing the trip by your own efforts, diminishing the world's sense of scale in the process. It's still a fundamentally unimaginative example of the genre it's aping, and completely fades out of memory the second you remember there are other fish in the sea. There's also the issue with voice acting, which is sporadically used in a way that does not mesh well with Oceanhorn's storytelling. A conversation will start in text, then, suddenly switch to voice-over. Tone and expression also fall flat in the face of dramatic moments: while the exposition from the hermit inhabiting the main island is okay, a bunch other NPCs fail to match the tone set by the script. When you save the leader of a race of owl-men, he expresses his appreciation zero inflection. Not-Link saves a girl later in the game, and they watch the town festival from a hilltop, and her ""I want to go off and see the world"" speech is hilariously Ben Stein-level deadpan. That tends to be the case across the board, and the more Oceanhorn tries and fails to raise ay emotion whatsoever, the more embarrassing it becomes. The journey's ease is sometimes appreciated, but it defines the entire experience. The only ace in Oceanhorn's pocket is that it's a type of game that typically doesn't see much play outside Nintendo's platforms, and it does stand out in that way. It's still a fundamentally unimaginative example of the genre it's aping, and completely fades out of memory the second you remember there are other fish in the sea.  ",,7.4
141,Peter Brown,,9,Owlboy,"Nov 1, 2016"," By their very nature, retro-inspired games are fighting an uphill battle against the nostalgia they aim to invoke. How can they form their own identity when they're partly designed to make you remember other games? After finishing Owlboy, it seems D-Pad Studio might have the answer. For almost a decade, Owlboy has lurked behind the curtain of mainstream releases with a small-but-devout following. Looking at screenshots and videos over the years, it was always apparent that Owlboy would look and sound great, but there's so much more to love about the final product: the humor, the varied cast, the disasters that befall its otherwise bright and uplifting world, and the incredible action set-pieces that punctuate the calm found elsewhere. It's not until you break through the surface that you're blinded by Owlboy's artistic brilliance and swayed by its heartfelt story. It begins with Otus--our muteprotagonist and the runt of his village--during a stressful dream where his professor and dark figments criticize his inadequacies and chastise his inability to speak. It's a powerful setup that endears our hero to you. Trouble brews shortly after he wakes up and concerns of pirate sightings explode into panic as a nearby metropolis comes under attack. Otus teams up with a military mechanic, Geddy, to put a stop to the pirates before their home is destroyed. Owlboy is old-school, not just in its presentation, but also in its storytelling--there’s no voice acting, and events are set in stone with nary a major decision-making opportunity in sight. The plot manages to avoid predictability, however, not only through a handful of twists, but by allowing characters to evolve throughout the course of the game. Sad moments aren't swept under the rug by unreasonable optimism--they stay with your squad and fundamentally alter their outlook on the mission and their own identity in surprising ways. There's great attention to detail in the cast's animations, which are often tailored for a specific scene, as opposed to falling back on routine reactions. Coupled with a script that's rife with emotion and nuance, Owlboy's characters feel real in your heart despite their cartoonish look. Owlboy tackles multiple artistic themes and subjects with consistently impressive execution. It may be a throwback of sorts, but Owlboy's visuals aren't tailored to specifically ape 8- or 16-bit graphics; it doesn't have a limited color palette, and its pixel resolution changes based on the scene at hand. When you enter wide-open spaces, the camera zooms out, chunky details shrink, and meticulously designed structures and environments take shape. In tight spaces, you're brought closer into the scene for more intimate inspection. From subterranean creatures to ancient structures, Owlboy tackles several artistic themes and subjects with consistently impressive execution. And if you have a soft spot for 2D games with multiple layers of parallax scrolling--where the background moves slower than the foreground to simulate depth--you're in for a treat. When you first take control of Otus, darting around floating islands and chatting with other creatures makes for a pleasant experience, and while the open air and bright colors deserve some credit, it's the orchestrated soundtrack that solidifies Owlboy's shifting atmosphere and tone. Violas and flutes instill merriment at first, but this innocence is short lived; when the pirates invade, oboes drone and cellos growl to the slow beat of a heavy drum. When the dust settles and the second half of your journey kicks off, sprightly piano compositions provide a much-needed respite from the stress of a society under attack. Your trek to the pirate's den takes you through expansive spaces and into the heart of sprawling cave systems where buccaneers and wildlife alike lie in wait. They typically bombard you with rocks and other projectiles, rarely engaging in close-quarters combat. On his own, Otus can only dash into enemies, stunning them at best. However, with the help of a handy teleportation device, he can summon one of three partners into his claws mid-flight to utilize their long-range blaster, shotgun, or webbing that can ensnare enemies and be used as a grappling hook to escape dangerous situations. Otus is unfortunately a tad slow by default, which causes you to spam his dash move repeatedly to keep things moving along outside of combat. There’s a modest upgrade system driven by collecting and turning in coins found in chests, but you're upgrading health reserves--in the form of soup canisters--and your team's weapons, not physical traits. Still, a keen eye and fast reflexes are more critical to success than any upgrades purchased during your adventure. Knowing that success comes from a show of skill rather than your ability to collect upgrades is gratifying, but you walk away from Owlboy with the sinking feeling that the equipment and upgrades in the game have unrealized potential. Owlboy is consistently charming and surprising, and when its final act doubles down on every front, it's bittersweet to see it end. Standard combat isn't anything special, but it never wears out its welcome thanks to deft pacing. Owlboy steadily mixes combat and exploration with measured stealth challenges, fast-paced escape sequences, and entertaining exchanges between characters. The chase/escape sequences in particular are some of the most impressive moments in the game, throwing you into a harrowing race against time in the face of tightly choreographed hazards. These scenes are challenging and filled with visual effects that add to the sense of danger, and they're overwhelming at first, but should you die, not to worry: Owlboy never truly punishes you for failure, allowing you to restart from the last room you entered. Owlboy is consistently charming and surprising, and when its final act doubles down on every front, it's bittersweet to see it end. As you relish the outcome of the final battle and watch the closing cutscene, you can't help but reflect on the beginning of your adventure and how far the world and its inhabitants have come. You'll never be able to play Owlboy for the first time again, but the memories of its magic moments stick with you. This is more than a treat for fans of old-school games; Owlboy is a heartfelt experience that will touch anyone with an affinity for great art and storytelling.","Owlboy focuses on the travels of Otus, an apprentice owl mentored by Asio.",7.1
142,Tamoor Hussain,Mature,6,Batman: The Telltale Series,"Aug 2, 2016"," Batman is no stranger to failures; they are the catalyst for his greatest triumphs. For that victorious moment where the Dark Knight rises, he must first be brought to his knees. Episode 3 of Batman: The Telltale Series does just this, but this time it's Bruce Wayne that's put through the wringer. In ""A New World Order,"" Gotham's golden boy is dragged through the mud by The Children of Arkham. At the end of Episode 2, the group's mysterious leader revealed that the Wayne empire was built on criminal activity. Bruce's father, Thomas Wayne, was not the saintly philanthropist everyone believed him to be. With these revelations, Bruce's legacy is tarnished and the anarchic Children of Arkham have turned the city against him. By the end of Episode 3, Telltale has all the pieces in place for a compelling comeback arc. However, it also becomes clear that the player is more of an onlooker than a participant in this story. Asking players to make a choice between two options carries an innate tension, even more so when you're mindful that Telltale likes to hit players with consequences down the line. Instead of pushing the narrative down new paths, however, the Batman series' decisions only branch briefly before reconnecting at predefined moments, shattering the illusion that the player has a hand in guiding the story. During the climax of Episode 2, Batman was forced to make a choice that should have had a lasting impact on the world and fallout on his relationships. It was a moment in which the player is empowered to drastically change the course of events, but in Episode 3, this decision is completely voided. Instead, events play out as if you had no involvement at all. On the one hand, certain character arcs and plot points are pillars of the Batman mythos and thus can't be altered, But on the other, the fact that Telltale motions towards subverting these long-standing tropes before pulling a bait and switch is disappointing. The dynamic between Bruce and Selina Kyle should be noticeably different in the aftermath of that decision, but in Episode 3 their relationship has barely changed. Sure, Selina Kyle is a strong, independent character that doesn't mope or complain about being snubbed, but the consequences of Batman's decision as they relate to her are quite severe, and it's not brought up as an issue, which further diminishes the player's agency. The fact that Telltale motions towards subverting long-standing tropes but then pulls a bait and switch is disappointing. The feeling that player input was inconsequential lingers, which is a shame because it can preclude enjoyment of other interesting decision-making moments in Episode 3. With Bruce Wayne's reputation in tatters, the Wayne Enterprises' board of directors decides to replace him. The player is placed in situations where they can choose to be diplomatic and secure an ally on the inside or act rashly to discredit his replacement. These moments are ultimatums filled with drama, but it can be difficult shake the feeling that it doesn't matter how you respond to them since the narrative course corrects. It also feels like the deeper exploration of Bruce Wayne that Telltale began in Episode 1 has fallen by the wayside. He's still the focus of the series, but it feels like he's a bystander in his own story. Things happen around him and he acts in the moment, but there's no emotional connection between them. The events of each episode have no lasting effect on his characterization. Sure, this is classic Bruce Wayne stoicism, but he's been portrayed that way for years and there's very little value in seeing that again. To its credit, Telltale makes a bold decision with its villain, the leader of the Children of Arkham, whose identity is finally revealed in Episode 3. It's an unexpected twist, but at the same time, the game didn't lay the foundations for it. As a result, it lands somewhere between shocking and bemusing. But perhaps this is casting judgment prematurely, given that two episodes remain in the series. That’s ample time to make good on the reveal. I'm ready and willing to be won over. Although most of Episode 3 is spent in the shoes of Bruce Wayne, you also get to do some detective work as Batman. Investigation makes its return in Episode 3, having been omitted from the second episode. As in the first episode, the opportunity to comb through an environment and find clues to piece a story together is a welcome. It's an aspect of the character often diminished in the Caped Crusader's video games that is realised here in a faithful way. Having said that, the puzzles Telltale has constructed offer almost no challenge as the solutions are very obvious. Combat sequences are brief but enjoyable, leveraging drama between characters to create tension in nailing the timing of quick-time events. On PC, I did encounter some frame rate drops during these sequences, but it didn't have a big impact on my success. Telltale's Batman series has passed the halfway point--and, unfortunately, Episode 3 fails to raise the stakes, present a fresh take on Bruce Wayne, or take the narrative in an interesting new direction. What started off as a series that had the potential to tell a more personal Bruce Wayne story is starting to feel like a missed opportunity. Nevertheless, Episode 3's twist does just enough to warrant seeing the series through to the end.  ","Enter the fractured pysche of Bruce Wayne in this dark and violent new story from the award-winning creators of The Walking Dead - A Telltale Games Series. Batman - The Telltale Series comes to retail as a Season Pass Disc, which includes Episode One, and grants access to the remaining four episodes in the season as they become available to download. The Season Pass Disc will give you access to a total of 5 episodes as they become available.",7.2
143,Miguel Concepcion,Mature,8,Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,"Nov 4, 2016"," In Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, the ease of traveling to space is as simple as pulling out of the driveway. This moment, in all its science-fictionalized spectacle, is emblematic of the rest of the campaign. The game's indelible cast has little time to be impressed with advanced technologies; they’re too busy fighting an intergalactic war. This story is Infinite Warfare's showpiece--a rare, finely constructed Call of Duty tale that manages to outshine its multiplayer counterparts, including a highly involving Zombies cooperative mode. Infinite Warfare's campaign kicks off with a classic sci-fi trope: Earth's dwindling resources motivates and drives humanity to colonize other worlds, but colonization and time give rise to an off-world insurgency. The version of this group in Infinite Warfare--dubbed the Settlement Defense Front--takes an aggressive approach, restricting the earthbound forces' resources with blockades while also racing them to colonize new moons and planets. When you take the controls as protagonist Nick Reyes, you promptly experience the savagery of the SDF firsthand. After the initial dust settles, Reyes undergoes a trial by fire when he's suddenly promoted and given command of his own ship, both while continuing to repel the SDF threat. These events reveal Reyes as a vulnerable leader, one who is prone to moments of apprehension or regret. The campaign only lasts five to seven hours, but Infinite Warfare's writers manage to craft meaningful characters with depth that rivals any from the Modern Warfare series. There's Nora Salter, Reyes' dependable ally who, up until recently, was the same rank as Reyes. Another example is chief engineer Audrey MaCallum, who appears for only a few minutes but manages to make the most of her limited screen time. As an ex-captain, she shares her poignant backstory, explaining how she gave up her commission by committing the mortal sin of caring for her crew. Caring and sacrifice are overarching themes that play into this story's key moments. This sci-fi tale doesn't have any aliens, but its standout character isn't human. ETH.3n (pronounced Ethan), a robotic naval petty officer, represents a new definition of a perfect military warrior: a strong, dependable teammate who can also soften a tense moment. He proves handy in every firefight, but his greatest gift is his wit. He jokes about having a farmer's brain and makes light of the rivalry between the Navy and Marines. At his best, he sounds uncannily human. Ethan is also your co-pilot and introduces you to Infinite Warfare’s exquisite spacecraft combat. Dubbed the Jackals, the game's highly maneuverable ships cast a silhouette reminiscent of an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. It's a thrill to chase targets through tight gaps and around columns. The most intense moments occur when enemies match your level of agility and aggression, forcing you to try to shake them off with sharp turns and salvos of diversionary flares. Call of Duty games have always had vehicles, but it's hard to recall one as involving and unforgettable as Infinite Warfare's. Many military-shooter campaigns are designed with a persistent--sometimes forced--sense of urgency. There's more nuance to Infinite Warfare's flow, where the pressure of an ongoing war maintains the sensation of forward momentum without feeling rushed. Moreover, its writers are wise to avoid the restrictive structure of chapter breaks. While this campaign features clearly defined missions at distinct planetary destinations, the story plays out more like a long film than a 13-episode cable series. One key ingredient to this cohesion and the narrative's invisible pull to press forward is minimal presence of loading screens. This benefit is accentuated in missions where you seamlessly transition from the Jackal to zero-G combat to on-foot shootouts. Infinite Warfare does not shy away from the cruel indifference of space. I winced at the effectiveness of sending a dozen foes into the vacuum by simply destroying a large nearby window or grappled myself to a string of enemies, cycling through the five or so fatal takedown animations (e.g. cracking the glass of their helmets, activating their grenades before kicking them away). Any momentary sense of guilt was forgotten when I remembered the SDF’s unforgivable actions during the story’s initial hour. There's more nuance to Infinite Warfare's flow, where the pressure of an ongoing war maintains the sensation of forward momentum without feeling rushed. The campaign's side missions, while skippable, elevate the overall experience of the single-player mode. Some of these sorties feature the campaign's most memorable assignments, such as an assassination plot where you're disguising yourself as an SDF soldier. The mission partners Reyes with Salter, and the appeal is as much about his banter with the lieutenant as it is about a satisfying opportunity to eliminate some high-level SDF officials. This optional section of the campaign also lets you log additional flight time since half the missions are Jackal operations. Given the limited opportunities to pilot the ship in the main missions, it's a joy to partake in additional dogfights and find ways to sink destroyers, often single-handedly. The profoundly hostile nature of space is, unfortunately, not something that can be found in multiplayer. It’s disappointing to miss out on the thrill of zero-G combat in a competitive online environment, especially when games like Star Wars Battlefront and Strike Vector affirm its appeal. What you have instead are the usual tournament-ready modes, a familiar playlist of match types that take no chances on new ideas. Defender is Infinite Warfare's version of Halo's keep-away game, Oddball, where it's often more stimulating to defend the ball carrier than be the ball carrier. And Kill Confirmed once again proves its worth as an alternative to team deathmatch – you must run to the spot where your target was killed and grab their dog tag for your kill to count, giving nearby enemies an equal opportunity to beat you to that dog tag--or worse, kill you and steal your tag as well. The result? Tense micro tug-of-wars that you can't find in classic team deathmatch. The new online battlegrounds are, unsurprisingly, inspired by environments found in the single-player mode but include a few exclusive locales, like a small Japanese urban center. Much like prior Call of Duty competitive maps, it only takes a few sessions to get the lay of the land, discern the best sniping spots, and discover high-traffic areas. Even the wall-running points are easy to commit to memory. As with the last two Call of Dutys, using walls can give you an edge in avoiding gunfire and catching ground enemies off guard. There's elegance in the simplicity of the maps, although they lack imaginative design, partly due to an overabundance of right angles. Multiplayer's mid-match and profile progression rely on a classic reward loop that recognizes skill--and the devotion to play matches for hours on end. That includes the return of the UAV, an assault drone that can wreak havoc and rack up substantial kills during a single flyby. Two new notable unlocks, depending on which class you select, are the Eraser--a gun that vaporizes its target instantly--and the Claw, which fires a horizontal rain of ricocheting bullets. These enhancements are welcome bonuses that add variety to the matches and are even useful in the hands of novice players eager to increase their kill count. Tied to these bonuses are the Rigs, Infinite Warfare's multiplayer classes. Rigs expands on the traditional FPS class archetypes where Stryker serves as the Support class while Phantom is the Scout. Warfighter mirrors the Assault class and it's supported in the frontlines with the high-tech FTL class and the Synaptic robot experienced in close quarters combat. Collectively, these class variants do not add anything substantially new to the matches though they're each worth checking out, even if their roles might fall outside your comfort zone. Zombies is an amusing contrast to Infinite Warfare's campaign in that this cooperative multiplayer mode is once again bereft of subtlety. It's a caricature of the 1980s, down to the neon-heavy art direction and a rapper in a tracksuit as one of the playable characters. The map and backdrop to these visuals is 'Spaceland,' a futuristically-styled theme park. It is the first of a number of planned Zombies maps for Infinite Warfare, designed as movie settings by a fictional film director named Willard Wyler. In keeping with the '80s motif, Wyler’s voiced by Paul Reubens (best known as Pee-wee Herman), whose sinister voice channels a hint of Vincent Price. What this mode lacks in aesthetic nuance, it makes up for in strategic depth. Zombies presents a risk-versus-reward scenario where opening up additional sections of Spaceland as soon as possible may not always be the best strategy. New areas contain new gear and zombie traps, but you increase the amount of enemy spawn points and the risk of getting separated from your team. A common benefit to opening up new sections? The attractions that can quash zombies in high numbers, like an arcade with a lethal laser dance floor. There's a positive sense of trial-and-error when figuring out what park-expansion progression works for you and you friends. By venturing beyond Earth--and not just to other planets, but to space itself--Call of Duty found a canvas to produce its best story in years. It reinforces the notion that a game's narrative is only as good as its characters. Given the campaign's accomplishments in space combat, it's puzzling that no effort was made to replicate its zero-G sensations in Infinite Warfare's multiplayer. Consequently, the well-crafted Zombies mode is a more attractive, time-consuming proposition for those looking to play with friends. While no Call of Duty game has matched the comprehensive excellence of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the exploits of Reyes and Ethan are at least as memorable and moving as any deeds from “Soap” MacTavish and John Price during from the series' heyday.","Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare will lead players through an unforgettable journey as they engage in heroic battles with hallmark boots-on-the-ground combat. The campaign spans our solar system, taking players on a journey from Earth to beyond our atmosphere. It’s grand scale war with unforgettable characters, rich emotional arcs, an epic new setting and blockbuster Call of Duty action.",5.7
